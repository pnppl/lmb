--<br>
<br>
It took me ten minutes to figure out how to actually <i>answer</i>
questions using this feature... ah, the learning curve. Again.
Succeeded, though, so there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, first question, cool! The answer is less cool, I'm afraid.
I have nothing new in the publishing pipeline at this time. In
general, I find my work-in-progress to be too fragile to discuss
during its early stages except with my old trusted Beta readers.
Also, talking about things that are only in the idea stage tends to
generate reader expectations that one risks disappointing. On the
bright side, if I do start talking about something, you probably
have a pretty good chance of actually seeing it someday.<br>
<br>
The next thing up in the career-maintenance work queue (which goes
on independently of anything new) will probably be helping prepare
an edition of <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i> for
print-on-demand, but first we have to finish up <i>The Spirit
Ring</i>, ditto.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.</span></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I'm reviewing
most of the books I've read lately here on Goodreads, because, why
not. GR makes it pretty easy. I think you can look up my reviews in
my "My Books" section, or find them somewhere on my profile page.
(It may take some scrolling.) I've picked up so many helpful
reading tips from internet reviews, it seems like a good thing to
pay it back, or forward as the case may be.<br>
<br>
My reading has slowed down lately, due to some retinal issues in my
left eye that make lines of print look somewhat like captchas. :( I
can't read for as long as I used to at a stretch till I find myself
reading with my left eye closed, which is generally my signal to
put the book down and go do something else for a while.<br>

had something special about it that made it worth the writing to
me. So it's an apples-vs.-oranges problem. That said,

best working with a character who has complicated and interesting
thoughts, an interior landscape worth spending time in. It is
increasingly the same case for my chosen reading, too -- if I'm
going to be spending hours -- or, in the case of a book I'm
writing, months -- in this other headspace, I want it to be a
congenial one. This seems to work for both fiction and nonfiction,
interestingly. This quality is also sometimes dubbed "voice", but I
think there's far more to it than just style. A quite complex
headspace can be expressed in plain language, but witty delivery is
very much a bonus. A character who offers dry wit and humor that is
sharp without being cruel along with his or her insights is a
special treat.<br>

thinking about this earlier today, when contemplating my
bookshelves and their remaining space. (I currently have space on
my shelves due to a recent drastic culling.) The answer to this
question seems pretty much identical with a list of my keepers,
which tend to run by author. In no particular order, Georgette
Heyer, Jennifer Crusie, Megan Whalen Turner, Terry Pratchett, Ben
Aaronovitch, the triple-headed Jayne Anne Krentz (she has two other
names she writes under.)<br>
<br>
It's a rare and happy event when a new writer is added to that
stable. I've recently become a fan of science writer Nick Lane,
although his are more "feel-smart" books than "feel-good"
books.<br>

don't have a lot of physical activities -- driving, chores,

most of all, I am a very visual processor with a very visual
memory. All of that works against listening. Although if I were to
acquire some hands-busy-brain-free routine task, that could change.
(I once had a friend who used to work at a particularly stultifying
data entry job while listening to audiobooks, which I found
boggling.)<br>

With my own books, it is pretty much impossible for any narrator to
exactly replicate the cadences and intonations I have in my own

Well, a Caz prequel would be barred from a happy ending, pretty
much. And a Caz sequel would be, inevitably, a lesser story than
the one already told.<br>
<br>
One of the things I'd wanted from the Chalion series, insofar as it
has developed, was to get away from its being stuck on one set of
characters in one time and place. I sort of want it to be able to
shift around to different times and countries and new people, and
perhaps different thematic and theological concerns. This runs
rather counter to the usual notions of series, which work to attach
the readers to particular characters. I don't know when or if I'll
ever follow this scheme up, or out.<br>

Nothing is promised, nothing is permanently ruled out. (And nothing
is in the pipeline.) But I don't foresee anything happening with
Chalion soon.<br>
<br>
I have finally bit the bullet and switched from "rest" to
"exercise", in a carefully supervised manner. (The Y, it turns out,
will rent you a trainer for a reasonable sum.) But that will take
some time to pay off.<br>

I did a few workshops early in my career, but in general I find
teaching pretty exhausting, so I duck those gigs now. The thing
about teaching is that one needs to be able to cover rather more
than what one knows, according to the needs of the pupil.<br>
<br>
As far as writing teaching goes, I usually direct people on to Pat
Wrede's blog, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://pcwrede.com/blog/">http://pcwrede.com/blog/</a> , or her

Oh, I have a bunch of fave anime. <i>Paprika</i> is probably my
favorite feature, though of course I also like most of the Studio
Ghibli offerings. Series include but are not limited to
<i>Mushi-Shi</i>, <i>Otogi Zoshi</i>, <i>The GokuSen</i>,
<i>Wallflower</i>, <i>Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi</i>, <i>Antique
Bakery</i>, <i>Junjo Romantica</i>, <i>Mirage of Blaze</i>,
<i>Shonen Onmyoji</i>... As a general rule I have no use for giant
fighting robots in any form, fighting samurai (<i>Samurai
Champloo</i> excepted), ultra-violence, grimdark, or horror, though
sufficiently Japanese folklore horror sometimes gets a pass.<br>
<br>
Since I am not an anime producer, adapting my work is not up to me
-- media adaptations are a buyer's market. But I have long thought
<i>Falling Free</i> would be good in that medium.<br>
<br>
No video games. I sampled <i>Dragon Warrior</i> and a few others
back in the 80s, and quickly realized that if I got any further
into this, my kids would die, my house would burn down, and my
nascent career would go down the toilet. So I have missed the train
on gaming.<br>

Nothing is promised, nothing is ruled out, but at present those
ideas don't spark anything for me.<br>
<br>
Readers often ask for more of the same, but I think in many cases
that's not what they mean; what they are really saying is, "Give me
a story that will make me feel the way that one did!" Which may
actually be quite a different thing, but is much harder to
articulate.<br>

Mm, family is difficult. My parents passed away years ago, my
father when my career was only starting. From one comment he made,
I gathered that my adult content was a bit dismaying to him; I
think that somewhere in his head, I was still twelve. My mother was
not a F&amp;SF reader, so while the writing part seemed sort of OK
to her, the genre was not something to which she related. "If you
want to write, why not try writing for the local paper?" she once
inquired, when I was bemoaning my early lack of progress. Leaving
aside the rural benightedness of <i>The Marion Star</i>, the
noncomprehension of this question seemed profound.<br>
<br>
Only one of my brothers is a reader -- he does like my stuff, and I
think reading it has brought me into focus as a human being for
him, rather than a vague fuzzball labeled "little sister". I gather
he found this rather unexpected. (He loved <i>The Curse of
Chalion</i>.)<br>
<br>
My kids, well, my children are rather opaque to me. Cordelia's
apparent maternal telepathy is the most wish-fulfillment part of
the character, from my point of view. My daughter has read at least
some of my work, and we relate to each other as adults nowadays, or
at least I think we do. My son has never, as far as I know, read
any of my fiction. Not sure what to make of that. (I wish he would,
for just the reasons you name above, but I can hardly make my books
required reading.)<br>
<br>
My friends pretty much consist of folks who like my stuff, because
there is, after all, a selection process at work there.<br>

I'm so glad you answer questions! My question is about the Chalion
series. I really love the way you approached the question of deity.
Especially _Paladin of Souls_, which made me tear up, even on the
re-read. What informed your attitude toward celestial
beings?</a></div>

I don't have any one source for that. It was more of a lifetime
accumulation of reading of all sorts, from C.S. Lewis through
<i>The Confessions of St. Augustine</i> to a smattering of mystics
from other religions to biographies of saints (Ignatius Loyola was
fascinating) to accounts of 19th C. leper colonies. Blenderize that
with my biology and science education, or at least pop science
education, that gave me a distaste for dualism, and strange things
happen.<br>
<br>
(Note that the gods of Chalion cannot really be called celestial,
as they are equally immanent at all points.)<br>

I am not at present in the mood for war stories, and I haven't done
any short work for decades, so probably not.<br>
<br>
It seems good that the books "run off the sides of the page" in all
directions for readers, though. It suggests that the tales are
engaging people's minds and imaginations, which is, after all,
their job.<br>

"/questions/304158-what-helps-with-figuring-out-how-to-tell-a">What
helps with figuring out how to tell a type of story that isn't told
often? For example, when you were working on the Sharing Knife
books and realized you had set up demographic and long-term
problems that your characters would tackle in books 3 and 4, what
helped you come to grips with how to do it? How did you bridge the
gap between wanting to write a story with an unusual shape and
actually doing it?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The short
answer is whining, lots of whining, but more seriously, there is a
certain inherent orneriness in picking unusual plot shapes or
protagonists, a kind of low mutter of "I'll show them!" After the
initial set-up, I do have to write my way into my books scene by
scene, and let the story itself show me where it's going and how
it's going to get there. I don't know how much suspense this
creates for the readers, but it certainly creates suspense for
me.<br>
<br>
So there isn't exactly a gap to bridge. There is wanting, and there
is doing. There really isn't an in-between state that isn't just
more wanting. (Or whining.) "Planning" for me is diffuse, broken
into small bites and spread throughout the whole of the doing.<br>
<br>
In other words, at the working face I am never writing a novel. I
am writing, at most, a scene (and then another, etc.) Or half a
scene, or a paragraph, or whatever functional unit I can actually
hold in my brain at one time.<br>
<br>
But, certainly, there seems not much point in writing a story just
like everyone else's, because they've already <i>done</i> that. I
could just read theirs, for a lot less trouble. (Which is not quite
the same thing as taking a trope or idea that delights me from the
genre cornucopia off to a corner to play with <i>my</i> way. I
certainly do that.)<br>

Lois, your Barrayarans are some of my favourite people in the
world. i loved the mix of cultures involved. Did you do much
research into Russia and Greece beforehand or did you wing it? I am
trying to write something set in Russia and I know scarily little
about the culture. I was hoping you might have some tips on
research.</a></div>

I was mainly drawing on already acquired background. Keep in mind
that Barrayar (or any other Nexus world) has about as much
resemblance to current Earth countries as, say, modern Portland,
Oregon has to 16th C. England and Japan. I'm not writing
contemporary or historical fiction, here, just fiction informed --
or flavored -- by history. You are setting yourself a higher
bar.<br>
<br>
That said, assuming actual travel is out of your reach (as it was
mine), you need lots and lots of nonfiction reading. You need both
general overviews, to give you a framework, and first-person
contemporary accounts, to find those telling details that all get
filtered out of general histories. Eyewitness writings become
harder to find the farther back in time one goes, but by the same
token, one is less likely to be overwhelmed by the choices.<br>
<br>
These days, you might also have the chance to get an on-line test
reader/friend from the country of interest to Beta read for you. I
know the fanfic community does some of that.<br>
<br>
And finally, it may be worthwhile to remember that one has set out
to tell a story, not write a PhD thesis. Research is potentially
endless and endlessly seductive, but there comes a point when it's
time to railroad.<br>

Short answer is, no.<br>
<br>
I actually think <i>Shards</i> would be much easier to make into a
feature film (that resembled the book -- not that Hollywood cares
about that) than <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>, which is the one
people seem to focus on. (Although the latter might go well as a TV
mini-series.) But movie rights are a buyer's market, and there are
very few legit, actually-capable-of-making-a-film producers
buying.<br>
<br>
I also think <i>Falling Free</i> could make a splendid animation or
anime. But, as I am not a film producer with access to hundreds of
millions of dollars and a couple-three decades of experience in the
industry, which is what it takes, it is not up to me.<br>

I remember reading that you started your writing career when your
children were young and at home with you. What was that like and do
you have any advice to parents trying to both write and care for
kids? I also want to join the chorus of your fans by saying "Thank

Well, I'm not sure there is a short answer aside from I Was A Lot
Younger. I'm not going to write my autobiography here in this
little box, but some of that period is touched on in my forwards
and afterwords to my Baen omnibus editions, which are now all
collected in <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i>.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure my guilt and time problems were any different from
those of any other working mother, but the open and self-directed
structure of writing makes it a lot harder and more confusing for a
family to recognize as work -- even after one starts selling --
compared to a parent who goes out the door at 8 and doesn't show up
again till 5. On the other hand, it was way more flexible -- I
never had to beg a boss for time off to deal with family
emergencies or illness, I didn't have to waste time on a commute,
and the actual core hours involved were usually fewer than 40 (or
50, or 60) hours a week. On the downside, getting paid was a rare
and random event. "I must go to work this week or I will be fired"
is a lot more immediate an argument than "I must go to work or I
might not get paid next year, maybe. Or perhaps the year after..."
Especially when one is mining the couch cushions for milk
money.<br>
<br>
I actually developed my writing process in that environment, by
collecting extensive notes in little bites over a period of days
and then, when they reached critical mass, hiring a babysitter or
using time my spouse was home to take my notebook (3-ring binder,
not laptop -- they weren't invented yet, and I couldn't have
afforded one even if they had been) to the public library and do
the core first drafting in short bursts. Not for me a process where
one sits in front of the computer for hours wrestling for
inspiration. Once I had the first draft nailed to the page, I could
bring it back and transcribe and edit in the more chaotic home
environment, ditto any and all para-writing tasks. Once both kids
were in grade school, this whole struggle went away -- school time
was writing time. I only sent a sick kid to school a couple of
times... :-( Summers, I went back to the old system, but since the
kids were indeed older it was all less fraught.<br>
<br>
Note that this all got started because, in a rust-belt town in the
middle of a recession, I couldn't <i>get</i> a day job. (If I had,
I might not be here today, so, whew for that.) How someone is to
juggle a day job, a family, <i>and</i> writing, I cannot advise --
that's one more cat/chainsaw/burning torch than I ever tried to
keep in the air at once.<br>

I'm afraid those are doomed to stay throw-away lines, along with
the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant.<br>

I am now having a vision of an annex to L-Space, somewhere, where
all those unused characters and ideas from the whole of literature
sit around getting drunk and complaining to each other about how
they were robbed of their rightful places in the spotlight...<br>

Cordelia ever got an apology, but in due course (after several
years) her criminal charges got ironed out, so she and her mother
could exchange a few visits. And, of course, so that Miles might
make his later visits, which he seems to have done unexceptionably
except for Bothari's assorted weapons violations.<br>
<br>
The general reaction to the marriage was at first imaginatively
negative; later, largely forgotten, as such news kerfluffles tend
to be. There might have been the occasional article such as
American women who marry important foreigners sometimes get, but
Cordelia would not have cultivated such. (Someone on-staff might
have been managing such PR for her.)<br>

Some considerable amount of this question can be answered by
this:<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/586996.Why_Buildings_Fall_Down?ac=1">
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5...</a><br>
<br>
which I'd read for general interest the summer, iirc, before I
wrote that section of the Ivan book.<br>
<br>
It also has, in that weird way writers' brains work, some
inspiration in a climactic scene in an old Alec Guinness movie
titled <i>The Horse's Mouth</i>. It's not a building that
unexpectedly sinks, but the sort of hidden-in-plain-sight setup is
reminiscent.<br>
<br>
But I did not actually come up with ImpSec HQ's fate until I was
almost at that scene in the writing. At the time the Arquas
discovered where the old lab now was, I had no more idea than they
did how they were to tunnel for access. From reading all those WWII
POW-camp memoirs, I knew tunneling was not a trivial task, but then
I remembered I was writing science fiction, and was not limited to
20th C. technology.<br>
<br>
How the Mycoborer (tm) could go wrong in so many ways was inspired
somewhat by my niece Molly's colon cancer awareness/teaching
project, The Colossal Colon, which I will leave you to Google. And
from <i>that</i> point on, the logical developments pretty much
wrote themselves.<br>
<br>
So it was a complicated tangle of feedback loops from many sources,
not a single tidy logical string.<br>

Well, that's not up to me; some maker of graphic novels would have
to ask to license it.<br>
<br>
There was one such deal a few years back in French for <i>The
Warrior's Apprentice</i>, with Soliel, who were going to do the
book in three volumes. The first (which I had thought was pretty
good, art-wise) sold so badly, they never did the following
volumes.<br>
<br>
Either my stories are hard to translate into visual media, or the
audience for same isn't much into stores like mine. Or both.
Although one data point is not a proof, it was rather daunting. So
I'm not holding my breath.<br>

At this stage of my life, I think I'd pick somewhere advanced with
really good medical care. But probably not Beta Colony, because I
like the outdoors too much. The less advanced planets, clearly, are
easier to set stories on -- more goes horribly wrong.<br>
<br>
The place is littered with space stations -- every advanced planet
maintains them, civilian or military, by their wormholes and in
orbit, and sometimes for several systems beyond. They all tend to
be rather alike, due to technological constraints -- even less
tolerance for things going wrong than downside. That said, it seems
to me I've featured a lot of them in the tales -- Elli's home,
Quaddiespace, the Hegen Hub, the factory one Miles captures in
<i>WA</i>, the one at the climax of <i>Komarr</i>, a dozen transfer
points in the Miles stories. <i>Mirror Dance</i> starts on one,
<i>CryoBurn</i> ends on one... the list goes on.<br>
<br>
Stations and ships do require highly self-controlled populations.
Planets, in addition to offering free air and gravity and all that
attractive space, have more elbow room for erratic behavior.<br>

I've never written any, but I've seen quite a few. In addition to
those seen earlier in my life, for several years after I moved to
Minneapolis, a friend and I had season tickets to the Guthrie
Theater, where we would take in 6 a year of considerable variety.
In addition, I was a member of a (now defunct) play-reading group;
we ran through quite a lot of Shakespeare, among other things.
(Modern playwrights were more of a problem to do due to variant or
unavailable editions.)<br>
<br>
Plays (as contrasted with TV and film, in which everyone's brains
are steeped) are interesting because the dialogue must carry so
much more of the story-telling.<br>

There was a movie offer back in the mid-1990s on <i>The Warrior's
Apprentice</i>, which went as far as a script. The script was so
dire, with less than zero relationship to the original book, I was
enormously relieved when they didn't go on to make a movie from it.
That experience pretty much cured me of any desire for a media
adaptation.<br>
<br>
Georgette Heyer never had a movie made from any of her books, but
in just two years she will be coming up on 100 years of her books
being in continuous print, read by millions over that time. I could
be quite content with a century-long career like that, even if
didn't live to see all of it.<br>
<br>
Making a movie of Miles would be harder than it looks, since so
much of the important action and humor is taking place inside his
head, in his thoughts, not visible to the outside observer, or to
the camera.<br>

I have no plans to do so at this time.<br>
<br>
I was a bit sorry that I'd given my universe such a very 60s-Analog
element, although in my defense I did give it a non-magical
physical substrate. ("There are no effects without causes" and all
that.) I'd have to think of something different to do with a rather
well-worked-over trope.<br>
<br>
(There was a good book by Rebecca (R. M.) Meluch that did some
pretty interesting things with a telepath... can't recall the title
offhand. It might have been <i>The Queen's Squadron</i> or it might
have been another.... (quick Amazon check -- yeah, that was it.)
Downer ending, though. She does good work -- check out her
books.)<br>

No such plans at this time.<br>
<br>
My current interests run more to comedy than to drama, I confess. I
think I'm also overdue for something completely different, without
a giant series backstory to wrestle. Making the same text serve,
simultaneously, trufans who remember it all, occasional fans who
have read only some stories and remember it only dimly, and
brand-new readers who know nothing except what is on the page in
front of them right now, is... a tricky balancing act. And yet
late-series books can also present other artistic opportunities
that single novels can't, so, go figure.<br>

I have nothing new going on with The Sharing Knife universe at this
time. I don't rule anything out, because I've discovered my
backbrain can ambush me unexpectedly, but certainly nothing
soon.<br>
<br>
Dag and Fawn's tale feels told to me (and at great length, too.) In
general what I need to start a story, and what I want to explore
during the course of it, is not a setting or an idea, but a
character or characters. Once I have the characters, well, the
question of "what ideas can challenge this person?" brings things
into line nicely.<br>
<br>
This is rather the opposite of some classic SF tropes, where the
characters are got up to display the ideas. The clearest example
being where some random Redshirt is sacrificed to demonstrate the
capabilities of the alien weapon; what's most important about the
scene is the weapon, not the person. This is also done on a much
larger scale and less obviously not just with alien weapons, but
with all sorts of things up to and including political ideas. My
brain does not seem to work that way. So what I need to start a new
project is not an idea, but a person (one who, for whatever reason,
matters to me) to whom that idea will matter.<br>

saga is brilliant. I'm pleasantly surprised how much I loved
Vorpatril's alliance which led me to conclusion that you managed to
achieve a specific mood where more than one character can be a main
protagonist without changing "feeling" of the story which I believe
is quite difficult :). Are you considering continuing quest star
stories?</a></div>

I am not sure what you mean by "quest star stories". Every
character is the center of their own universe, and therefore every
character has some story potential. Some will be more interesting
to me than others, but then there follows the question, "Will this
interest sustain a whole novel?" Those are more rare. (Jo Walton
has dubbed this centering quality "protagonismus".)<br>
<br>
There's also the matter of plot-character interlock, as each
creates the other. Some characters come with one perfect plot, and
when that tale is told, they're done, ready to retire. Some more
flexible characters can sustain more than one plot or one kind of
plot, and from these sorts the writer can more readily squeeze a
series.<br>
<br>
The most difficult thing with late-series books is wrestling the
backstory, even when it's cut down to just the most immediately
pertinent backstory. This was pretty readily do-able when I just
had 6 books; 16 is more of a challenge. As I've said elsewhere, the
exact same text must be made to simultaneously serve the dedicated
fan who remembers everything, the occasional reader whose
familiarity with it all is dim, and the new reader who can know
nothing but what is on the page now. Tricky stuff.<br>

Technically, there are not multiple religions; there are multiple
heresies of one religion. Which can certainly supply all the fun
and games of any other religious conflict, and more, as history
shows.<br>
<br>
The gods of Chalion are all about souls, and are indifferent to
politics as such. People who want to conscript the gods to their
side find this deeply confusing at times.<br>
<br>
What's really interesting to consider/speculate upon is how a
person might contrive to be an atheist in the world of Chalion.
People being people, I bet some manage it.<br>

Before Captain Vorpatrils Alliance was published, it was released
and sold as an e-arc. I gathered at the time that was a bit of an
experiment. Did that work out for you? Is that some thing you would
consider doing with future releases? Assuming you have a say in
such things, of course. I, for one, will buy anything you care to

The e-ARCS are a Baen Thing. They do it for selected lead books,
according to some calculation of their own.<br>
<br>
The e-ARCS have worked out just fine for me, so far. One of the
fringe benefits, I have found, is that we get several hundred free
proofreaders, to catch all those little glitches that have escaped
the editorial net so far (and there are always some.) One must
filter out the things identified as mistakes which aren't, of
course, and there is inevitable duplication, but on the whole I
have found this beneficial.<br>

It certainly is a distraction, but if I didn't have it, I would
just go looking for something else. I suppose I needed something to
replace all that computer solitaire... (I finally had my son take
the game off my machine.)<br>
<br>
If the writing is going well, it's not too hard to ignore the
distractions. If not, not.<br>
<br>
There are physical limits in play as well -- only so much eye and
butt fatigue tolerated per day. One must be aware of one's
endurance and use one's limits wisely. Or so I theorize...<br>
<br>
The constant tug back to older works is a subtler problem. I have
that on the pro side as well, in the editing and proofreading of
new editions of older material. I just spent the past two weeks
going over the files of books I'd written in 1983 and 1984,
bringing them up to my 2015 punctuation standards and so on. This
is not time I spent thinking up anything new, so I suppose it adds
up. (It was a pretty good way to spend two weeks of a Minnesota
February, however.)<br>

My direct-placement e-books are all currently available in Kindle,
iPad, and Nook versions. There is some doubt among the people who
help me with these things that Kobo is a large enough vendor to be
worthwhile; this may change in future.<br>
<br>
The old Fictionwise got bought out and eaten by Barnes and Noble.
So all those placements are long gone.<br>
<br>
HarperCollins does seem to have my fantasy novels up in the public
library Overdrive system. I don't have a clear idea about how that
is working out. I would like to get my direct placement e-books out
on there as well, but that is waiting on finding out more.<br>

series get bogged down in later books by having to involve every
character ever named and bringing them up to date. I love the way
you've avoided this in the Curse of Chalion series. And we've seen
Miles from birth to Count, so even as a fan, I'm not sure I'd want
more. But are you working on a new series, or is this a forbidden

There are no forbidden questions as such, though some may get more
satisfactory answers than others.<br>
<br>
I am not working on a new series at this time.<br>
<br>
Should I have anything new to announce (winters in Minnesota are
long, dark, cold, and conducive to indoor activities, after all), I
would make a blog post. However, as I am not one of those people
who counts up their clicks (why, for pity's sake?), I'm not much
into teasing. If there is something firm to say, I'll just say
it.<br>

Aside from improving the copy-editing, no. I figure those books
were written by that Lois, then; they belong to her, and I
shouldn't go messing about with them. They say that in 20 years
even one's bones replace themselves. I think the 2015 Lois would be
better off spending the time writing something new than in diving
down that endlessly extending rabbit hole. (Because, of course, ten
years from now I would have yet another perspective, etc.) Also,
Han shot first.<br>

Or, of course, I could spend more time goofing off. I am very

Cool vid, but the most intriguing part is not shown, which is the
3-D printer. I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens with
that technology.<br>

Not sure what this has to do with a hypothetical Miles movie,
though. Downey himself is too old to play Miles, alas.<br>

tiny, but: In your head, do you pronounce Tej as "Tedge" or "Tey"?
South Asian languages vary a lot, so Tejaswini _could_ be either
"Tedge-a-swee-nee" or "Tey-as-vee-nee." It's silly, but it kept
tugging at the edge of my brain as I read _Alliance_. Ended up
switching between the two randomly, whichever "sounded" appropriate
at the time. I know your answer may not change this for me, but I
wondered. Thank you!</a></div>

I pronounce Tej with a soft J like "Bujold". ;-) More that soft
French J than the harder sound of edge or ledge. I'm trying to
think of an English word that has that sound... I'm sure there must
be one, but I'm blanking on it right this moment. Bon jour and all

Well, Cordelia has had 40 more years of complicated living and
observation by then. She is also at that moment about as
emotionally exhausted as it is possible for a person to be.
Cordelia's thoughts represent Cordelia, not a platform for the
author.<br>
<br>
I had <i>planned</i> to end the book upon the words, "Count
Vorkosigan sir?" But the epilogue presented itself to my brain over
about a two-day period during my revision stage, sluicing through
at white heat from wherever such things come from. Confluence,
compounding, confounding, all of those; but not planning in the
sense this question posits.<br>
<br>
That said, I have had since I wrote <i>Shards</i> a lot more
experience, both directly and through watching friends and
relatives up close, with those end-of-life issues that cluster
around the body outliving the mind. (And I'd had considerable
observation before then, as a hospital worker.) When I was 15 and
first read the appendix to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> that
recounts the death of Aragorn, I did not understand it, and
resisted it fiercely in a fanficcish sort of way, right along with
Arwen. I don't argue with it now.<br>

If anyone else does, feel free to chip in. I'm not sure if the
Spanish branch of Amazon would be a help, since it does not meet

My brain is pretty quiescent just at the moment, having just come
off a book project that took (with assorted interruptions) three
times longer than usual, and with the final edit still to go. I
think the next thing on my agenda is a few more bites of
semi-retirement. Plus some fresh reading and watching, and then
there's the Minnesota summer to enjoy which, after the Minnesota
winter, one is due. After that, who knows? Certainly not me.<br>
<br>
So glad you liked The Sharing Knife! That one tends to get short
shrift sometimes.<br>

I envision them as like military cadet tunics -- jackets with high
round collars, variously fastened. One can see the style in a lot
of anime boys' high-school uniforms as well. (I was just rewatching
xxxHolic -- there's an example.) Also Nehru jackets. In short, I am
using the two terms almost interchangeably.<br>

I've been mulling over when to say more. I'm thinking late fall,
just before the eARC becomes available, but I'll probably break
down and say some things sooner.<br>
<br>
I figure if I give you all very much information, you'll all race
ahead and make up the book in your heads yourselves, and then be
artificially nonplussed, later, when the book I wrote doesn't match
the one/s you've envisioned. If a reader has less time between
learning about a book and reading it -- picking it up cold in a
store, say -- there is less chance for that phenomenon to
develop.<br>
<br>
It is not a war story; it is about grownups; it is not grimdark but
still embeds some serious themes. It is science fiction. I expect
reader response to be all over the map, because it always is.<br>
<br>
Some readers will love it (I say this with some confidence, because
some already have), some will hate it, and there will be
approximately ten thousand reviews that go, "This wasn't the book I
wanted! Here, let me give you this 500 word outline of outline what
she <i>should</i> have written..." Each one different from all the
others, of course. (That one's a sucker-bet.)<br>
<br>
What say you all? How much information to you actually want to get,
in advance?<br>
<br>

I've pretty much given up on the idea of cover art as illustration.
Thematic covers would be OK, if one could come up with iconic

Er... all of them?<br>
<br>
Although not, it must be said, all at the same time. I pick and
choose from all that I know/have done/have read according to the
needs of the story at hand. Insofar as the stories are not all
alike, neither are their sources. (I think what makes this question
so hard to answer may be the "consistently" part.)<br>
<br>
Also note that jumping off from this substrate of "the entire
contents of my head" to a story involves a whole lot of
transformations, amalgams, cross-linkages, and other meta-games as
a natural part of creativity.<br>

Ah, there's a question often asked.<br>
<br>
I don't think "serving her time" is a correct way to think of her,
as she was never jailed. She got away with a remnant of Randall's
Rangers; how long she held them together afterward is another open
question, but I suspect not long. If nothing else she'd have had to
abandon them so as to be less findable by Cetagandan hit squads.
Whether she finally managed to evade them is another unanswered
question. If not, she no longer exists as a potential plot
generator. If so, she'd still want to stay as far away from that
quadrant of the Nexus that contains both Barrayar and Cetaganda as
possible. She's pretty twisty, but I don't think she's into the
sort of deranged revenge as an end in itself that could cost her
more than she stood to gain.<br>
<br>
Not that she would turn up her nose at any revenge that came along
as a bonus side effect of other efforts. But it wouldn't be a
goal.<br>
<br>
She was obviously an adrenaline junkie, or she wouldn't have been
in the line of work in which we first encountered her. While she'd
doubtless have less of that as she aged, her post-<i>Vor Game</i>
employment could go to either legitimate or non-legitimate
enterprises, as long as she saw profit in it for her.<br>
<br>
Another open question is how much she learned from her Hegen Hub
experiences, and what-all she identified, once she calmed down, as
"That was a mistake -- let's not do that again."<br>

I think they did manage to catch the queen again, but a few stray
liveried worker bugs would still be turning up here and there for a
long time after the events of <i>A Civil Campaign</i>. Possibly as
far as a few blocks away. Given that the bugs are clearly labeled,
I can see random persons returning them to VK House for the reward
if they could catch them... or generating interesting paranoid
rumors about them if they couldn't.<br>
<br>
Miles would not be much inclined to laugh till after the dividends
from assorted bug enterprises started to come in. These would do
quite a bit to soothe him in due course. The Armsmen, well... 20
guys, 20 possible responses, so you have a range of possibilities
there. Possibly also pegged to who invested early and who
didn't.<br>

Ah, good question to get clarified.<br>
<br>
The surname is "Bujold", and my books should be listed under the
Bs.<br>
<br>
McMaster is my maiden name, which I use as my middle name. So there
should be no hyphens, either. Both stores and libraries, as well as
readers, sometimes get confused about this, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
(I sometimes wish, as I am sitting there writing my tripartite name
over and over at book signings, that I had gone with the shorter
"Lois McMaster" as my writing name, but it is too late now to
change. At least Bujold appears higher in any alphabetic list,
which can't hurt for visibility.)<br>

Caz came first, and hung around in limbo for rather a long time
till his setting, with a lot of pre-fabricated plot elements,
arrived in the form of 15th C. Spanish court history. The idea of
the curse slotted in subsequently -- I mean, a curse would explain
<i>so much</i> about the real historical place and period...<br>
<br>
The proto-Caz might have alighted in some other country of the era,
as I was especially interested in that cadre of men who rose from
the middle classes to become the right hands of assorted kings and
queens and wrangle the transition from medieval realms to more
modern styles of nation-states. Walsingham, Cisneros, Richelieu,

In general, potential ideas or settings don't do much for me till
an interesting character arrives. Only then does a story come
alive.<br>

Vorkosigan saga is a masterpiece. Mindblowing thoughts ran through
my head while reading it. The world you have created is
magnificent. I wish HBO wanted to record tv-series of books. Would
you sell them the rights? Have you ever had an offer for a film
adaptation? Big greetings from Croatia.</a></div>

If we had a viable, legitimate offer, sure. It's a buyer's market,
though. Very few production companies are up to creating such a
media series -- it takes a barge-load of money and highly
experienced people -- and they have a million books to choose
from.<br>
<br>
I had one feature film offer about, good grief, twenty years ago
now, which went as far as a script, which was unfortunately dire.
It pretty much cured me of any excitement or hope about the
process, I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
There would likely be a better chance of more of the actual book
making it onto the small screen than the big one. Although
<i>Falling Free</i> (animation!) or <i>Shards of Honor</i> might
actually work better for a feature film than the Miles tales, as
they are shorter and more self-contained.<br>

Hope it works out!<br>
<br>
Indeed, I never pictured my own stories' ships moving through Nexus
normal space using reaction mass of any kind. Gravitational rowing,
for all I know, but not spitting stuff out the back end at high
velocity. <i>So</i> many problems with the physics of that.<br>
<br>
(Yes, I know "fuel" gets mentioned, because one can't get something
for nothing, not to mention "thrusters", but one should not be
picturing chemical combustants.)<br>

Well, your first speculation is not wrong, but, taking them as an
undetermined box in which anything might be happening as long as it
didn't impinge on Cordelia's then-frame-of-view, I would expect,
with 8 or 9 men, several possibilities. Any who were known
loyalists to Aral would have been put under arrest, if Vordarian
could catch them before they went underground. One or more could
have died resisting or defying arrest. Any he could suborn, he
would have. Fence-sitters would have found plausible bolt-holes,
but not have been trusted by Aral afterward, and would have been
encouraged to retire.<br>
<br>
Vordarian didn't have long enough as emperor to appoint his own
stable, I'm afraid. Luckily for them.<br>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, <i>The
Curse of Chalion</i> was written on-spec, conceived as a
stand-alone, and finished before I ever offered it to a publisher.
So I don't think I was thinking of an Ista-book before then, even
though that last scene does seem to be a promissory note in
retrospect. However, HarperCollins wanted a three-book contract
(which we cut down to two, because I had become skittish about
mortgaging my future -- remember, an advance for an unwritten book
is not income, an advance is a debt, which must be worked off), so
I had this big blank spot to fill. My obligation was just for "a
fantasy novel", content unspecified.<br>
<br>
I do remember describing my initial ideas for Ista to my HC editor
Jen Brehl at one of the Worldcons (?), sitting on tall stools at
some trendy cafe, and getting the usual nonplussed look I get from
editors when I try to describe my initial ideas. I remember much
the same look on Jim Baen's face over dinner at Philcon '89, when I
was first describing <i>Barrayar</i>. They seem to get over it by
the time I turn in the manuscript, though, so that look of vague
editorial dismay doesn't counter-alarm me anymore.<br>
<br>
The book still took some developing. It was competing for my
attention with what became <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, as by the
concatenation of circumstances I had ended up with contracts from
two different publishers for unwritten books, and each was blocking
progress on the other, which was when I discovered that I am really
not a writer who can work on multiple projects at the same time.
After nine months of fretting I eventually set Ista aside to
concentrate on <i>DI</i> first, and things started to move again.
Once the book for Baen was bagged, I was able to give Ista my total
attention. Happily, during the intervening year some new ideas
slotted into place, filling out the scheme, so the extra gestation
time was all to the good.<br>

Yes, he was. One of them, at any rate -- very seldom does
inspiration have only one source. (The young Winston Churchill also
has a foot in there, somewhere.)<br>
<br>
The movie came out when I was a teen; I followed up with a lot of
reading about the man himself including that memoir, which was a
deal more complex and a bit beyond what my shallow teen brain could
process, but I suppose the stretch was good for it. My
understanding grew better as I grew older and learned more, both
about the period of history and people generally. It has been some
decades since I revisited <i>Seven Pillars</i>; it would be
interesting to reread it again now and see how much it has changed,
including in light of a half-century more of history unfolding.
:-)<br>
<br>
Also interesting, if you can find a copy, is Lawrence's <i>The
Mint</i>. A tinge of that went into Camp Permafrost, in an oblique
sort of way.<br>

there a listing somewhere that gives the Vokosigan Saga in the

chronology. I collected the earlier books over time, and read them
as flashbacks.</a></div>

Hm, I'm going to have to throw this one open to other GR
participants to answer. I don't have one up my sleeve. Wikipedia
might have something.<br>

My own usual list is internal-chronological, here:<br>

One can usually find first publication/copyright dates on the back
of the title page in a paper book, though the omnibus editions and
magazine publications sometimes confuse that. I'm not sure there is
a set standard placement of such matter for e-books.<br>

Wodehouse has been an occasional read for me, and certainly not an
early one. So I wouldn't name him any kind of major influence.<br>
<br>
The Vor came more from Japanese samurai with a dash of European and
Russian military castes.<br>

No, I'm afraid I haven't read this writer, although her name sounds
dimly recognizable (I won't say familiar). Wikipedia, I see, has no
entry for her. I find a Judith O'Reilly mentioned on Amazon,

I can't say as I've thought much about bucket lists. One of my
long-time ambitions was realized when <i>Captain Vorpatril's
Alliance</i> made the real NYTimes bestseller list, what gets
shorthanded as the Big List -- my later books had tapped the
extended list enough times by then to make me think it possible and
not a pipe dream.<br>
<br>
Regrets, I think, are not bucket-list material. "I wish I'd done X
differently in 1969," and the like. Also dangerous; if one could go
back and change things, one might risk arriving at a less
satisfactory outcome in the long run. Other things tend to be not
under anyone's control, such as, "I wish my spine would stop having
arthritic deterioration." Death would halt such declines, I
suppose, but it's not a solution I favor. Be careful what you wish
for and all that.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy right where I am, really.<br>

Yes, of course. I was probably driven through most of them by
economic pressures that were indifferent to my feelings.<br>
<br>
"Changing the world" or even "changing the world of science
fiction" was never my goal, fortunately. "Not getting my utilities
cut off for nonpayment of bills" was. That, happily, turned out to
be a more feasible aim.<br>
<br>
It is the nature of the book market that one cannot be financially
successful without also being well-known, one's name being one's
brand-name, more or less. Which is felt to be the means and which
the end will vary from writer to writer, natch. And whether one
really needs "rich and famous" or if "self-supporting and
well-known in my field" will do. Beware those moving goalposts,
which can always make one feel artificially bad.<br>
<br>
"How high is up?" is one of those dangerous questions that each
writer must answer for themselves. Setting goals unrealistically
high guarantees frustration, too low risks not challenging oneself
to do as well as one otherwise might. (As a rule of thumb, it is
also better to focus on what you can do, and not on other people's
non-controllable responses. "Finish a book" is controllable, "sell
a book" less so, "become a bestseller or win an award" still less
so. Unhappy is the writer who boards this train wrong way
round.)<br>
<br>
As for time, it passes at exactly the same rate for everyone,
regardless of how one chooses to apportion it. It's all choices and
tradeoffs. Some prices might really be too high, some rewards too
meager; only the person who is leading that life can decide.<br>
<br>
That said, when I contemplate the ever-upthrusting mountain range
of reading matter in the world, effectively infinitely more than I
could ever read in my remaining lifetime, I do sometimes wonder why
on earth I'm trying to make more, yeah -- if that were my only
motivation. Except that writing is in itself an intrinsic pleasure
for me, if a weird one -- I sometimes wonder if writing fiction
ought to be classified as a dissociative disorder. So I would
likely still be making up stories even if no one else wanted them,
only with less social approval.<br>

This is going to be a very interesting real-life experiment in
unexpected consequences, as time goes on. I've been watching it out
of the corner of my eye for quite some time. The article does
suggest it makes a big difference whether the women in question are
of an educated class or not -- but that would make a difference
anyway, so, hard to tell at a glance.<br>

read my way through almost the whole Vorkosigan series in the last

any "dream casting" of actors/celebrities as your characters? (As
someone who has a hard time drawing a mental picture from text,
especially when it comes to faces—it's a weird neurological

This seems to be a common fannish sport. I don't do it much, but if
you like, you can picture Oliver Reed playing Aral, and Paul Darrow
playing Duv Galeni. Cordelia might be vaguely
young-Vanessa-Redgrave. Illyan seems to be some kind of cross
between David McCallum and Walter Koenig. Adjust ages as
needed,<br>
<br>
Miles is hard, although there was an actor who played Richard III
in a long-ago TV production that had something of him, lots of
energy. Have forgotten his name. (Checks internet -- Ron Cook -- 30
years back. 1983 production, tho' I don't remember when I saw it.)
Otherwise, characters' visages mostly float, even when I'm writing
them.<br>

Multiple personality disorder is an old, and perhaps somewhat
factitious, idea. The more recent notions about dissociative
disorders generally seem to rest on somewhat more solid
foundations. The rest was creative insight; putting myself in
Mark's skin and thinking it through, which is what a writer does
when creating any character, more or less convincingly.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Mark and Kareen will ever marry; they seem to be
getting along fine with a galactic-style partnership. If they did,
they might well have a choice of which legal codes to marry under,
which could matter. If they ever decide to have children, that
could change, but probably won't until that point.<br>

<br>
The backstory of the first malice is almost as vague in my mind as
it is in the characters. I figure to fill in the details if I ever
write a prequel which, I admit, does not seem likely. But it
involved the most powerful magics of the old mage-lords, a deal of
hubris, and an attempt to pull in something that was Not Of This
World. From there, things did NOT go according to plan.<br>
<br>
I do believe that the alien-ness of the malices is from that
Outside; their evil, all from their human parts or programming.<br>
<br>
Dag's people have very limited written records of the Old Days, and
some oral traditions more-or-less distorted in the retellings.
Their broad outline is more-or-less correct, but there are a lot of
missing details.<br>

that characterization is something I <i>try</i> to focus on... it
seems to come "for free" for me. (Referring to a metaphor about
writing where every writer has different aspects of the craft that
seem to come easily to them, and others they have to work for.) I
have to work for plot, and setting, and, argh! names, tech and
worldbuilding, and magic systems if extant, theology, politics,
architecture and clothing design and so on. But if a character
presents him/her/itself as interesting enough to write about in the
first place, they seem to come walking onstage already pretty
integral. Also, nearly impossible to alter in any arbitrary
fashion, even though they grow and change with the story. Mountains
are easier to move.<br>
<br>
Though they do tend to go through a stage early in their
development (and, indeed, later on in the tale) where I keep trying
story and backstory on them to see what fits, like a frustrating
shopping trip, but that feels more like discovery than
invention.<br>

Once I have a character, everything else can be added. Without a
character, everything else is useless.<br>

enjoyed Pen and Des -- I certainly enjoyed writing them. (And do
pass the word -- this work is getting no promotion beyond word of
mouth.)<br>
<br>
I have no plans to expand this novella as such. It is not
impossible that the characters could have further short (although
35k words is not actually "short") adventures someday, a series in
miniature, but nothing is in the works at this time. (I am back to
being semi-retired for the rest of the summer.)<br>
<br>
I <i>really</i> enjoyed getting to write something short, after the
prior novel that took three years (though to be fair, a lot of that
was life-interruptions.) But for a novella one needs to have just
the right idea to fit the length. Short stories and novelettes seem
too short to me to get in much character development -- they tend
to be more idea-centered snapshots. But novellas are just long
enough, elbow room without bloat. Whee!<br>

something about what kind of spirituality Paladin of souls is

some truths in there that are truly universal.</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The first two
Chalion books were written over a decade ago, now, so my recall of
their composition is getting vague. I had a life accumulation of
occasional church attendance, but more important was probably
reading. Some C. S. Lewis, a book by Thomas Merton, something by an
Islamic mystic, some readings on Buddhism, Taoism, and Shinto,
<i>The Confessions of St. Augustine</i>, biographies of St.
Ignatius Loyola and that fellow who went off to found the leper
colony in Hawaii, Teresa of Avila, and so on. And reading, yes,
about real-life mystics, mostly from the Middle Ages in the course
of my general historical filter feeding of the era.<br>
<br>
The serious mystics across religions do seem to be zeroing in on
something similar, and recognize it in each other, though whether
it is some subtle universal equivalent to the hiss from the Big
Bang, or just the 60-cycle hum of their own biology, I am not sure.
(Though I suppose it could be both.)<br>

I'm pretty sure Gregor went to the interment as Gregor, and was
barely conscious of what he was wearing. I'm also pretty sure his
valet put him into whatever was correct, that morning. I don't know
if there is an equivalent Imperial uniform to House Blacks. At this
last, private stage of things, a civilian suit is also a
possibility. It would not have been the gaudy parade red-and-blues,
anyway.<br>

Everybody has accents; the Vor are no exception. That should be in
the plural, of course, given all the different regions and language
groups on the planet. Some accents would be more associated with
high status or places of origin than others, and thus aped, and
whatever the BBC uses most would tend to spread. Barrayarans don't
have quite the mania for placing/pegging each other by their voices
as do the Brits, but they come close.<br>
<br>
The Vorkosigan family accent runs to something like "British actor
doing stage Russian accent".<br>

Betan is closest to American Midwestern, yes.<br>

found "Penric's Demon", however inadvertently!<br>
<br>
I'm not planning anything at this stage, though I'm open to
possibilities. Part of the reason for the Penric tale is that I
wanted to explore direct e-placement, which, among other things,
has far fewer constraints on length or topic than other modes of
publication. I'm certainly counting the experiment a success.<br>
<br>
But, really, Penric's tale happened because I wasn't <i>trying</i>
to write at all, but rather, had relaxed and kicked back. With my
brain less busy, there was space to listen to myself think. (The
internet, I observe, is quite willing to keep one's brain
frantically busy 24/7.) Also, an idea needs to be of the right
weight and length for a novella; too little and there's nothing to
say, too long and it turns into a novel, which is not the point of
the exercise. I will say, <i>finishing</i> something in a mere
three months was a real treat. So, we'll just have to see.<br>

question I plan to leave to readerly speculation. However, if a
double-dominant dose of the gene is required for the telepathy to
kick in, in standard Mendelian inheritance patterns, it will
actually be the second generation after Ethan that starts to show
the effects, and then, of course, only if primed with enough
tyramine. The very first actives would likely put it down to
drunken hallucinations, with a few poor boys wondering if they were
going crazy, till word got around.<br>

available as an e-book. First will come the eARC, Advanced Reader's
Copy, effectively the same as my galley proofs, which will be for
sale off Baen's own website in advance of publication by a couple
of months. The usual price for these is $15. The regular, fully
corrected e-book will be released no later than simultaneously with
the hardcover, I think. (I should probably cross-check this
data.)<br>
<br>
It's more important for publishers to get accurate early pre-order
data for print books than e-books, due to needing to decide on the
size of print runs and arrange all with the printing company, for
the books to be printed and shipped by the pub date. E-book "print
runs" are indefinitely instantly expandable, as long as people
don't crash the server...<br>

Oh, I should add there will be a pre-signed hardcover edition for

<br>
No special catalyst, except that his time had come, and Miles was
overdue for a rest. I'd had a notion for a story for him before
(give him a Cetagandan princess!), which failed to jell. Lots of
fan requests for more Ivan fell on the usual politely deaf ears
till I had a new idea (give him a Jacksonian mafia princess!),
which even recycled a little of the old idea as a bonus, and we
were off and running. Or strolling, in Ivan's case.<br>
<br>
The most important part of the practice for him was giving him a
viewpoint in <i>A Civil Campaign</i>, I think, which he'd never had
before, allowing us to explore his hidden shallows.<br>

"/questions/534521-there-s-a-story-i-don-t-think-i-ve-ever">There's
a story I don't think I've ever found. In the list of Miles'
stories, it's when he's 25. And the blurb says it involves Simon,
changing bones for Miles and in a hospital, and foiling a plot
against his father. Supposedly, the title is Borders of Infinity,
but that story is about a Cetagandan prison camp, according to the
collection Miles Errant. Am I missing something?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Ah, this is a
frequent confusion, engendered by that old Baen timeline, I
think.<br>
<br>
Back when I was putting together the three Miles novellas for the
fix-up collection <i>Borders of Infinity</i> (note the absence of
the "The" -- and of quote marks, which signify a short story), Jim
Baen asked me to write a frame in which to embed the three tales to
make the volume look more like a novel, as collections didn't sell
well. Which I dutifully did, making it a sort of little story,
because that's what I do. It does not in any way stand alone. I
have Miles remembering or telling the three episodes to Illyan
while in hospital after a mission, plausible reasons for asking or
remembering supplied by the frame.<br>
<br>
The three novellas plus the original frame may be found in the
collection (or novel) <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, currently
available as a direct-placement e-book and in other formats. The
frame was dropped when we broke up the novellas to fit in the
chronology of the omnibus volumes, as it would have made no sense
in that context.<br>
<br>
If I had realized back in the 80s how much confusion it would make
in the future, I would have titled the collection something very
different from the title story! Too late now, so I just have to
keep explaining to people.<br>

Not at this time.<br>
<br>
I had an official offer to sharecrop from Baen, years and years
ago, and turned it down. It just doesn't mesh well with the way I
work. Too much is intuitive, too much generated on the fly, too
much just-in-time world-building, too much control-freakery. Trying
to work with another writer would be a huge communication burden,
and all the fun parts would be left out, from my point of view.<br>

That goes all the way back to <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> in
1986, when (admittedly mentioned in passing by Tav Calhoun) Beta
Colony's arrangements are indicated to be highly flexible. And
there was that poly family in <i>The Sharing Knife</i>. Athos... is
in a class by itself. Lots of variety in the Vorkosiverse, although
mercenary fleets, naturally, are not much about family formation.
Jackson's Whole, anything can happen and does. And then there are
the Cetagandans, the ghem indicated to practice polygamy sometimes,
the haut deeply mysterious, no idea what their ordinary citizens
get up to, and so on and on.<br>
<br>
A lot of the stories touch on an exploration of what might happen
when sexuality and reproduction are truly technologically
separated. Sexuality becomes optional and malleable, and much less
fraught, but somebody still has to change the babies' diapers, or
they will die. Not everyone needs to have children, but all
characters need to have parents -- or some SFnal equivalent, and no
cheating by having people raised to adulthood in vats and anyway,
who would run the vats? So.<br>
<br>
No new books are in process at the moment, so I can't predict what
I may like to explore next.<br>

generation, they had lost electricity, and were down to wind,
water, and muscle power for a time. Loss of tech went hand-in-hand
with loss of social cohesion, and came back much the same way. By
the last quarter-century before the end of the ToI, they were
getting electricity back. There followed about 15 years of very
rapid development between the rediscovery and the Cetagandan
invasion, half a generation. Development continued throughout the
Occupation, in erratic patchy ways. Lots of off-planet imports

wanted to thank you first, you are one of my favourite authors. I
discovered that I have trouble introducing miles to new readers.
Cordelia's Honor works with women, but they want a Cordelia book
after. Warriors Apprentice- a friend said, fun read, but she did
not crave for the next book. it really had me thinking. Maybe
Memory is a good start for readers who shy away from space

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, I
wouldn't rec starting with <i>Memory</i>, simply because so much of
the impact of the book rests on what went before. I don't think
there is a sure-fire Vorkosiverse starter-book -- readers' tastes
are too different, and the books are not all the same. The series
does build by accumulation, and I have tried to make each volume
work as a stand-alone, although that has become harder over
time.<br>
<br>
<i>Borders of Infinity</i> is a sort of sampler-platter, and short,
so that might be worth trying.<br>
<br>
I could ask readers to chime in, here, though I'm pretty sure it
would not result in consensus.<br>

open at the end of <i>CryoBurn</i>. I, Gregor, and Miles are all
conscious of the conflict-of-interests issue. I'm sure Miles at
least offered his resignation. Gregor might have more-or-less
stored it in the refrigerator, holding Miles in reserve for any
galactic contretemps that might call for his special expertise, but
keeping him out of any Empire-internal cases.<br>
<br>
An Auditor's powers are not a 24/7 (or 26.7/7) thing, but activated
and deactivated case by case. Jumping one between cases would
automatically <i>create</i> a case, however, so, like many things
on Barrayar, it has ambiguities that only Barrayarans seem to
readily parse.<br>

of Japan is more structural, on the authorial level, than internal
in terms of fictional founder population. (Though the 50,000
Firsters were undoubtedly more racially mixed than most readers
seem to realize, drawn from four different kind-of-European Earth
regions 200 or more years from "now".) But Japanese history gives a
worked example of cultural isolation and forcible rediscovery that
is most evocative, psychologically and politically, when thinking
about SFnal lost-colony scenarios. Useful stuff.<br>

always a burden to me. When working in a made-up universe like
Chalion or the Wide Green World, I often brainstorm potential name
lists in advance of the story, so that when a new character pops
onstage I don't come to a dead stop for three days trying to figure
out his/her/its name. I have a prefab list of dozens, and just run
down it till one pops out as feeling right for that individual.
This also allows me to create a more uniform sense of language/name
groups and so on. (Taking a region on a map, chopping all the names
into syllables, and recombining them can lend a subliminal sense of
language/culture unity to a name list.) In working in the
Vorkosiverse, I am very happy to now live in the age of Wikipedia,
where I can pull up lists of authentic ethnic Old Earth names at a
mouse-click. Beats the heck out of the days when all I had was the
local telephone directory and some syllable-scrambling.<br>

For a while, I was trying to do dinners for a group which included
a vegetarian, a person on the Atkins diet, and a person who did not
like fish. I think I finally had them brown-bag it...<br>
<br>
There are some classic old SF stories about vat meat versus dietary
shibboleths, which the commenters can probably chime in with.<br>

"spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[(Not only does the
question contain spoilers, so does the answer. Beware.)<br>
<br>
<br>
The answer varies with the specifics. I'd been thinking about the
business surrounding the Cetagandan pullout from Barrayar for at
least 15 years, or at any rate, so long that I've forgotten how
long. I wanted to put it in at the end of Ivan's book, but was
talked out of it by my test readers for issues of tone control.
Aral, of course, has been canonically bisexual, and Cordelia
canonically Betan, since 1983. I can't think how anyone could have
missed that, but oh well. Readers.<br>
<br>
Jole had been a glint in my eye since 1989, when I wrote <i>The Vor
Game</i>, but that development certainly didn't belong in that
book. (Nor in any of my other books of the 90s, when my most
critical concern was career-building in order to make a living/not
fall back into poverty in an extremely demanding literary
marketplace.) The Sergyar developments were not thought of till
after I'd written <i>Memory</i>, certainly. Then after the turn of
the millennium I went off to write those seven fantasies for
HarperCollins, with no plan to get back to the Vorkosiverse at all
till Toni Weisskopf coaxed <i>Cryoburn</i> out of me. And then the
Ivan book came along on its own, for lagniappe and for fun.<br>
<br>
And then people kept asking and asking (and asking, and also
asking) what happens to Miles after <i>Cryoburn</i>, which fell on
deaf ears till I realized it was the wrong question. The real
question was, what happens to <i>Cordelia</i>. This book is the
answer to that question.<br>

if Leo and Silver had kids, but it is not ruled out. They would
have needed biotech aid. Quaddie names were for a long time one
unique name per quaddie, which, as the population expanded, got to
be a stretch before they went to adding the numbers to allow
duplication.<br>
<br>
Yes, Delia was named after Cordelia; the latter is probably her
actual legal name.<br>
<br>
5 almost 6, 11 just turned from 10, a few months slipped in
somewhere, variants in planetary year length... many retcons are
feasible.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Ivan and Tej have had kids "yet", nor where he is
posted, nor, indeed, what his "new career" really turned out to be.
Ivan presently exists in an electron cloud of potential, position
unknown<br>
<br>
Nikki did not choose to be adopted, and did choose to retain (and
perhaps redeem) his family name. In his immediate Vorsoisson line,
he is the senior male, being only son of the only son to have
offspring, and possibly not too many brothers/uncles upstream.<br>
<br>
Baen doesn't seem to be doing library placements at present, though
HarperCollins is, and has my fantasies for them up in many
libraries' e-systems. Blackstone Audio also has good library
placement. I would like to get some of my
direct-placement/self-published Vorkosigan e-book backlist up, at
the very least a couple of titles to test the waters, but have not
so far succeeded in doing so. I'm not sure which one or two would
be best to experiment with.<br>

fingers. Did you develop this theology completely from your own
creative imagination, or was it a partial not to the five elements
of the Ancient Chinese world view? Much else of your theology
delighted me.</a></div>

acquaintance with a number of different real-world religions
informed the Chalion books, I think the Five Gods are original,
both in underpinnings and in a lot of details. Some ideas are
stolen and modified, such as the rather check-mark-shaped signing
of the Five over the five theological points (four if one is
Quadrene) versus the Catholic signing of the Cross, which is also a
mnemonic.<br>
<br>
The ancient Chinese probably had less influence than several other
sources. Otherwise, I used lots of natural elements; the hand, the
seasons, human familial relationships, and so on. Five was also
attractive because it resisted, to a degree, dualism, which I think
is a way of looking at the world that tends to create a lot of
ill.<br>
<br>
The two religions in <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> had some inspiration
from the clash between early Christianity and the Germanic, Saxon,
and Nordic pagan religions of the so-called Dark Ages. Great
Audar's career borrows elements from Charlemagne, for example.
(Well, steals, perhaps, since I have no intention of giving them
back.)<br>

<br>
Yes, I "knew" what Jole was (although not yet his first name) back
when I first wrote <i>The Vor Game</i> in 1989, though he existed
then more as a cloud of potential than as a known position. That
potential expanded after I wrote <i>Memory</i>, circa 1995, which
packed Aral and Cordelia off to Sergyar and incidentally extended
Aral's narrative life by a decade. For the next 4 volumes the
series followed Miles, who, you may have noticed, is a trifle
self-centered, and thus so are his books.<br>
<br>
Jole might have continued to exist merely as my private amusement
if I hadn't been drawn back to write first <i>CryoBurn</i> and then
<i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i>, during which my speculations
about him solidified, and then invited his story. The first notes
hit actual paper in early 2011, when I was stalled on Ivan's book
for various internal and external reasons. I then picked up Ivan's
tale after a radical revamping and finished it, so I didn't get
around to writing the first scene of <i>GJ&amp;RQ</i>(which became
the second scene of the actual book) in early 2012. (2/26/2012, my
computer files tells me. Huh.) Reader demand to know what happened
after <i>CryoBurn</i> also fed into this, as I gradually realized
that the aftermath that really interested me was not Miles's, but
Cordelia's.<br>
<br>
Writing Jole's story did its usual trick of creating him, or at
least, making him visible to me, in greater detail, and he finally
achieved the character-density you see by the end of the book. (Not
to mention that first name.)<br>

no-aliens is an old bifurcation in space opera. The formative works
I was reading back in the 60s offered both models. A lot of the
aliens tended to be just people in costume, and not just on <i>Star
Trek</i>. Two models of the latter choice for world building were
of course Asimov, who had humans-only, and the less-well-known but
amazing writer Cordwainer Smith, who had extensive bioengineering
of both human and animals, and who was much the bigger influence on
me.<br>
<br>
By the time I began writing, science was beginning to catch up with
the bioengineered future Smith had envisioned, and the "aliens are
us" notion seemed even more plausible. By the time I'd finished the
first couple of volumes of my not-planned-in-advance series, I'd
pretty much committed to the bioengineered-humans model, and that
if there were any advanced aliens in our galaxy (which is a big
place not only in space but in time -- two such species could miss
each other not only by light years but by millions of years) they
wouldn't show up in in my characters' lifetimes.<br>

Lois! I'm really trying to take a crack at writing. I seem to find
inspiration in everything these days. I literally can't have a
conversation with someone or go for a walk without wanting to
capture the experience in a story. But I've found that I'm
extremely uncomfortable with my voice on the page. Everything feels

In general, my characters seem to have their own voices and
opinions, to which mine are necessarily subordinate. I owe them the
most honesty I can muster, and everything I know (at the time.) I
find this more liberating than uncomfortable, although that may be
some species of displacement. I have to forget the audience and my
careful social-self while I am writing, although readers certainly
come to the forefront of my thoughts when it's time for marketing,

I think Pat has some posts in the book I just rec'd, or certainly
on her blog, on the problems of keeping the internal editor from
crippling the internal writer. I am also reminded of a complaint
from long-time <i>Analog</i> editor Stan Schmidt, frustrated about
writers coming up to him and explaining that they didn't send him
this or that tale because "it didn't seem like an <i>Analog</i>
story." "It's not your job to reject stories for my magazine --
it's mine!"<br>

I was curious as to wether you have ever been approached about
writing any Star Wars novels? Would that be something you would be
interested in? I often wondered how the process would work, would
you be given a storyline and go with that, obviously sticking to
certain histories within the canon. Apologies if you have been
asked this many times which i suspect you have. Thank you for your
time.</a></div>

I was approached once for Star Trek novels, long ago, but for me
that starship had sailed. They should have asked me in 1968...
:-)<br>
<br>
I believe all the big franchises have some sort of story bibles
these days. (In the early days, when all this was first being
invented, things were more free-form.) But it's not something I'm
interested in -- I want to write my <i>own</i> stories -- so I've
never investigated further.<br>
<br>
My friend Pat Wrede was approached through her agent and contracted
to write the middle-school novelizations of the last 3 Star Wars
movies, back when. But she was under legal obligation not to talk
about it, at the time. But those were a lot more constrained than
the side novels, as she was working from "live" scripts (some of
them still wriggling.)<br>

Vorbarr Sultana is not earthquake country; such events there would
be unusual and alarming even to earthquake veterans. Nonstandard
details such as the plumbing and other connections ripping out of
the walls as the building went down would likely also be
attention-grabbers.<br>
<br>
As the building is windowless, its inhabitants wouldn't have been
treated to the sight of the earth rising up past their windows, but
it has plenty of other monitoring to give alarm. Until that, too,
was buried or borked as events magisterially proceeded.<br>

good question to throw open to the readers at large -- more
suggestions in the comments, folks?<br>
<br>
Depending on my mood, I have been fond of the Regency romances of
Georgette Heyer. Middle Pratchett is always good -- very early
Pratchett hasn't found its voice yet, late Pratchett sometimes
tends to more dark. Jennifer Crusie for contemporary (or, by now,
then-contemporary) romantic comedy. Ben Aaronovitch's <i>Rivers of
London</i> series isn't comedy, but narrator Peter Grant's voice
and views are pretty amusing at times. Megan Whalen Turner's YA
fantasy series starting with <i>The Thief</i> is also very
re-readable (try to avoid spoilers, going in.)<br>
<br>
I also like animation and anime -- pretty much all the Pixar and
Dreamworks offerings, Miyazaki of course; other, quirkier things.
<i>Paprika</i> is a fave feature-length film, <i>Mushi-shi</i>,
while it is not comedy -- it might be "gentle horror" -- a favorite
series. The series "The Wallflower" is... not readily
describable.<br>

Some good Shakespeare comedy on film includes the 1997 production
of <i>Twelfth Night</i> starring Helena Bonham Carter, and the
nicely goofy 2000 production of <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> done as
a 1930s Hollywood musical.<br>

<span id="freeText10138427843788263529" style="display:none">If you
haven't read the Villiers series by Alexei Panshin (Star Well; The
Thurb Revolution; Masque World; collected as a Kindle e-book called
New Celebrations for some reason), do so. I strongly recommend
them.<br>
<br>
I rate these as the best Comedy of Manners of the 20th Century.
There was to have been a fourth volume (The Universal Pantograph)
but it was never written. If you enjoy the first three as much as I
did (and do; I reread them every few years, just as I do LMB's
books - thank you for all you have written and will write, LMB!)
please encourage Alexei to consider tackling the fourth book.<br>
<br>
Just as many people claim that All Wisdom can be found in the
Godfather series of movies (Leave the gun; take the cannoli), I
claim that All Wisdom can be found in the Anthony Villiers series:
(Company always improves travel, as Temujin is reputed to have
remarked,) and (The trouble with traps as an instrument of policy
is that they lack the ability to discriminate) and (Tastes can be
educated. Exposure is the important thing.) and ("I'm a
pragmaticist," he would say, meaning that he had no education and
he was selective about his principles.)<br>
<br>
Oh, and for the OP (original poster), these books are
excruciatingly funny (although not directly intended as comedies).
Deadpan humor (much of as throw-aways or asides), much like good
Pratchett.<br>
<br>
For video, you MUST see the Commedia delle Arte version of Taming
of the Shrew. (Look for the one starring Marc Singer.) If this
doesn't get you laughing until you get a stitch in your side, I
will be astounded.</span> <a data-text-id="10138427843788263529"

worked out the timeline in detail (and if I ever had, the paper I'd
have written it on would be long gone by now anyway.) But, sure,
roughly right. I put the Ceta invasion ~15 years after the end of
the ToI, and it lasted ~ 20 years. I'd put Dorca's unification
later, since he survived right up to and through most of the
Occupation; although he might have been merely the emperor to
finish, rather than start and finish, that political process. I've
never established when Aral was born in relation to the end of the
Cetas, but, if not before, soon after. Have no idea what you mean
by "canonization of the Vor caste", although equipping them with
and/or shooting them <i>from</i> cannons would occur toward the
middle-to-end of the ToI.<br>

mainly, I expect. These were the sorts of stories I grew up loving
in my teens. (1960s vintage, plus any earlier work lingering on
local library shelves.) I didn't come to reading romances or
mysteries till later, in my 20s, though they were both inboard as
interests by the time I started writing for professional
publication in my early 30s. Also, because of my reading
familiarity with the F&amp;SF genres, and with conventions, I had
at least a vague clue how to go about submitting work, and where,
which I lacked for other genres.<br>
<br>
Mostly, though, F&amp;SF are universal receivers, like certain
blood types; they can absorb any other genre's plots, tropes,
styles, and ideas. So an SF writer does not, at least in theory,
have to give up any literary possibilities, or restrict their
creative range.<br>

saw a made-for-TV remake with the original cast some years back,
which wasn't all bad. If there is a new remake, I haven't seen it
yet.<br>
<br>
Also, not 14 now, which makes a difference. Dear God, has it been
fifty years...?<br>
<br>
A huge number of people of my generation were fans of that show;
not least, I suppose, because there were far fewer choices of
things to watch back then, which tended to concentrate and enlarge
the audiences.<br>

I just recently watched <i>The Tale of Princess Kaguya</i> and
thought it very fine. I can also highly rec <i>The Story of
Saiunkoku</i>, and have also liked the work of CLAMP.<br>
<br>
I haven't had time to watch for a while, but I am always interested
in recs for the better-grade stuff. (I don't have <i>time</i> to
sort through the drek myself.)<br>
<br>
(A quick check finds none of your recs currently on Netflix, my
source, tho' they do offer a 1992 edition of <i>Arslan</i>. Any
relation?)<br>

reader for &gt;50 of my 62 years, I had until recently only heard
of Miles. I'm now 3 books in (Warrior's Apprentice), & hooked. Work
of this quality is why I read sf. Thank you for this great
pleasure. I have minutes ago learned of Michel Petrucciani, a
French jazz pianist of astonishing musicianship & refinement. He
suffered from brittle bones, & was short of stature. Were you aware
of his work before Miles?</a></div>

that Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen is available for pre-order on
Amazon (done), but no Kindle version. Is a Kindle version planned?
I haven't quite given up on "real" books (I still get hardcovers
from my favorite authors, among whom you are included) but my
preferred method of reading these days is on my iPad. I don't
process verbal communication very well, so audiobooks are of no use
to me.</a></div>

the e-version is supposed to go up at the time of its release. I do
not know why there is not a page or pre-order option for the
e-book. So, Real Soon Now, but not quite yet. (The e-version will
also be available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"
href="http://www.baenebooks.com">www.baenebooks.com</a> , when the
eARC comes down.)<br>
<br>
A bit later: I asked of Baen, and got this expansion:<br>
<br>
"The ebooks do not go on sale on Amazon as pre-orders. They are all
put up on the 16th of the month prior to publication.<br>
<br>
It is available now as a partial at Baen Ebooks, so your readers
can even get started if they want. The entire download will become
available on January 16.<br>

http://www.baenebooks.com/p-2893-gent...</a><br>
<br>
All ebooks purchased at Baen Ebooks are perfectly capable of being
read on the Kindle. There are various ways to do it, but the
easiest by far is just to use the book’s sales page to email it to
your Kindle. I am a Kindle guy, and I do this all the time. There
are instructions there on the page when you sign in with a Baen
Ebooks account. It’s very easy to do.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the ebook will be for sale January 16, 2016 on Amazon
and other ebook sources including iBooks, Kobo, B&amp;N, etc."<br>

<br>
I have not yet received an offer from a French publisher for the
book, so, not soon. (It would have to be licensed, then translated,
then go through the publication process -- this usually takes a
year or more.) Translations are a "buyer's market", thus not up to
me.<br>

No, I don't have a full list of all Vor names on Barrayar, Counts
or otherwise. (Nor do I have a 30-volume leather-bound copy of the
<i>Encyclopedia Barrayarica</i> in my garage, though it is, I
suppose, a testament to my worldbuilding that so many people seem
to imagine I do.) There are more Vor family names than there are
countships. There has also been historical turnover of clans in
countships, for all the possible reasons.<br>
<br>
I have never established what's going on with the government
structure of South Continent, except that it is not countships, new
or old. When last heard from they were directly held Imperial (not
Count Vorbarra) lands, presumably divided up as needed for local
government.<br>
<br>
The terraforming of S. Continent continues as people get to it. It
will be a generations-long project.<br>
<br>
There have to be more interesting big islands and island chains as
well, not mentioned yet... With examples before us of Hawaii,
Iceland, and New Zealand, it rather seems to depend on what the
plate tectonics are doing; which could be more or less active than
Earth's.<br>

McMaster Bujold, Thank you so much for answering all these
questions! Of the Vorkosigan books, A Civil Campaign is especially
delightful because it's a departure from the tone of the series --
I always think of it as a comedy of manners after lots of
(wonderful) space opera, military fiction, family drama, etc. Did
you conceive of it this way? Are there other modes that you'd like
to write in but haven't?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I'd wanted to
write a Barrayaran regency romance ever since I awoke to the fact
that Barrayar had this perfectly good regency lying around. Aral
Vorkosigan's regency was long over by the time this book came
along, but why should that stop the parade? A lot of other elements
went into the book, not least Shakespearean comedy... somewhere
around is a long fannish discussion of them, <i>A Reader's
Companion to A Civil Campaign</i>. Aha, free pdf is here --
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://dendarii.com/ACC-Companion.pdf">http://dendarii.com/ACC-Companion.pdf</a>
-- warning, large file.<br>
<br>
At this point, I could write in any mode I wanted, so long as I
liked it enough to have internalized it. One reader-reviewer even
described <i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i> as an
SF-mainstream crossover, which may be a bit of a stretch, but not
for me to say. Whatever the mode, it would have to be a story I
relished enough to slog through the bog of actually writing.<br>

Nope; I had never heard of them before you told us just now.<br>
<br>
Jole came out of my head when I first invented the character, back
in about 1989. He acquired his first name four or five years ago,
when I began to develop the ideas for his book, which I created in
a common way by generating a list of possible names and staring at
it till his name presented itself from the pack.<br>
<br>
He came really close to being Perry, a nickname for Perrin; dodged
that bullet... Oliver suits him much better.<br>

More anxious than relieved. Granted that the cover is not
embarrassing, and is actually thematically emblematic of the story,
and doesn't give readers anything to complain about having "got
wrong", but will it <i>sell</i>?<br>
<br>
What people claim they want, and what they actually buy, may be
less congruent than imagined.<br>

Oh, gosh. No secrets, no secret handshakes. Persons looking for
practical writing advice might do well to start with Pat Wrede's
blog or her book <i>Wrede on Writing</i>.<br>
<br>
As for me, there are two books that discourse at length on the
topics of how I write: <i>The Vorkosigan Companion</i>, edited by
Lillian Stewart Carl and John Helfers, and my own <i>Sidelines:
Talks and Essays</i>, which is an e-book collection of most of my
nonfiction writings of the past three decades, which are generally
about writing. (I shall not retype them all here...)<br>
<br>
My work life has changed over the years as my life has changed --
how I operated in the 80s was different from the 90s, and again
from the 00s, and is now very different again as I work out what
semi-retirement means to me.<br>

Good question; I 'd have to write a story to learn the answer. It
is among other things unknown how much Horseriver was lying about
that library, using it to explain his knowledge actually acquired
by living through his times. It's also unknown if he left whatever
he possessed behind, or destroyed it, although the progression of
the story suggests the former. I'd think the Temple would be first
in line to seize anything interesting, posthumously. I. & I. might
get to see it later...<br>

Yes, Arde and the pilot Cordelia suborned/hijacked are intended to
be the same -- one feels that his unfortunate encounter with
Cordelia was the beginning of the slippery career slope that ended
with the poor schmuck in the heap where Miles found him.<br>

As I was writing fanfic possibly before the term was invented (and
so were a lot of other people), any other answer would be quite
hypocritical.<br>
<br>
I once wrote up a little essay on the topic, good grief, ten years
back now; a bit out of date but in parts still pertinent.<br>
<br>

<br>
This essay was written just a few years pre-Kindle and the e-books
marketing revolution, which is a whole 'nother conversation and
then some. (The link at the end of the essay to the old City Pages
interview is long dead.)<br>

probably a little late in reading the Chalion series. Your writing
style in those books is exactly what I've been looking for.
Character development for Cazaril and Ista is wonderful. I want to
read all my other fave characters out in the world written with
your touch, from your perspective. I like how you see the universe.
Any possibility of a new Chalion in the future? P.S. The Bastard is
my secret favorite.</a></div>

you've found <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> yet, or the novella "Penric's
Demon", both set in the same world but in different time periods
and with completely different casts of characters (except the
gods.)<br>
<br>
Yeah, I think most everyone likes a trickster figure, especially
including storytellers.<br>
<br>
My <i>The Sharing Knife</i> tetralogy has a deliberately different
"voice", as suited to its world, but it is more fantasy.<br>

In general, SFnal audiences do not care for stupid protagonists,
unless it's a tragedy like <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>. After all,
the tacit understanding is that readers are expected to identify
with the protagonists, and if there's one thing the SF crowd
valorizes above all others, it's brains. They also don't much care
for stupid <i>antagonists</i>. So that role is pretty much
relegated to side characters.<br>
<br>
That's not to say even smart characters can't make mistakes or have
biases; they just do it on a higher and trickier level. When a
smart man sets out to fool himself, he has to be really convincing.
I believe Michael Shermer has some whole books on this subject.<br>
<br>
The other authorial trick is of course to make the protagonist
young and inexperienced, in which case the story arc must include
them becoming less so. Inexperience can be fixed; stupidity, almost
by definition, can't, since it pretty much consists of <i>not</i>
learning better.<br>
<br>
There is also a psychological mechanism whereby people defend
themselves from information or learning that threatens their
self-identity; also not the same thing as unintelligent since it
happens at every IQ level.<br>

I think they may have shown up a few times, but very seldom. I
don't remember my dreams well, except for a few I'd rather forget;
most of them seem to be about travel traumas. Or home repair
traumas. I have spent more time in insanely snarled airports in
dreams than in my waking life.<br>
<br>
Alas, my dreams have never been any help at all in figuring out my
stories, except that if I don't get enough sleep (very common these
days with chronic insomnia) I can't write. Or think. Or move,
much.<br>
<br>
Which makes me wonder, does anybody <i>else</i> have useful dreams
about my characters?<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The notion of
Jole's character and relationships existed ever since he popped
onstage in <i>The Vor Game</i>, which I wrote back in 1989. But
that wasn't what the books I was writing then were <i>about</i>. So
the ideas rode along through time in a potential reservoir of story
that I dub "Schrodinger's Cat Carrier". No telling whether a
story-cat is alive or dead till I open the box to actually write
it.<br>
<br>
Then there followed those several years when I was writing the
seven fantasies for HarperCollins, and didn't think I'd ever get
back to the Vorkosiverse at all. But then I wrote <i>Cryoburn</i>
at a special request from Toni Weisskopf following Jim Baen's
death, and then Ivan's book because it seemed like it would be fun.
And by that time, 2011 or so, I realized the cat was definitely
alive, and yowling to get out. So, to continue the physics
metaphor, it was both preexisting and slotted in; both a wave and a
particle.<br>

got me for Christmas this year:
http://cecilyjeanne.tumblr.com/post/138516867218 You're now up on
my office wall for all time! I got her to read the Vorkosigan books
a couple years ago and it's been so fun to squee with her and see
these new covers out in the wild. (Here's the customary question

Ah, excellent!<br>
<br>
I think Ron Miller was very proud of those covers, and pleased to
get the chance to do something outside of his usual range. (Plus,
there's always the chance that some visitor to your office will see
them and ask, "What's this...?")<br>

I should point out, vat meat has been a science fiction staple for
decades; it's not original to me. There have been a number of

Well, one of them was certainly getting back too late from
Kibou-danii to see Aral again, and say all those last things he
wanted to say. (And, his night thought whispers, if only I had been
there at that moment maybe I might have saved him somehow...) The
death of Bothari is certainly one, which Cordelia does know. The
death of the pilot officer may be up there; Miles may believe she
doesn't know about it. I think she might. Miles's career-destroying
lie to Simon Illyan is high on the list, though possibly not the
highest. Going after Mark on Jackson's Whole , or at least the way
he did it. Really, he's spoiled for choice, and readers can pretty
much fill it in as they please. Not to mention the option of
off-stage events we haven't seen.<br>

No, not tempted. Fans are great, but travel <i>hurts</i>. I have

such. Apparently, I am not afraid of flying, but am of the

middle of rereading The Warrior's Apprentice now. I was struck when
Elena tells Miles that Baz has made up his own story about who
Miles is--that he's essentially exiled for being a mutie and his
younger brother has ursurped his place. Minus the exile, that's
pretty close to Ser Galen's plot. Did you know that already when
you wrote The Warrior's Apprentice?</a></div>

place I had seen it before was the character Richard Galen from
STTNG (there's a bit of a family in-joke about the latter). Where

Galen is a fairly common name, going back to Roman times, where it
was attached to a famous physician and medical writer. For
Komarrans, I wanted Italian-flavored names, to evoke Venice.<br>
<br>
Megan Whalen Turner has a physician minor character named Galen
somewhere in her YA fantasy series starting with <i>The Thief</i>,
which your son might be ready for in a year or so. I expect she was
also thinking of the noted Roman.<br>

This is the sort of detail I leave up to the readers' imaginations,
although my own description of Barrayaran traditional fashions runs
to "Ruritanian". As <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> was set in a
fictional middle European country and written by an Englishman,
both of your ideas for sources have merit.<br>

Or I suppose, you could go in Betan sarongs... :-) Your climate may
not permit.<br>

contains spoilers… <span class='spoilerAnswerText'><a class=
"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class=
"spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[It's a little unclear
just what aspect of my endings you are objecting to. Ethan Urquhart
and Terrance Cee ended up in a happy, homosexual, harmonious
satisfying relationship, which I don't regard as any less
unrealistic and untrue than any other characters' fates. (Well, the
telepathy thing is arguable.) How to typify Lord Dono I leave for
others to debate. Utau, Razi, and Sarri were in a longstanding poly
relationship, as were Aral, Oliver, and Cordelia for many years.
Umegat and Daris clearly had experienced an exceptionally rough
time, but they seemed to have come to a quiet harbor when last seen
by the narrative. I don't see how anyone could have regarded
Ekaterin and Tien as happy, hetero though they certainly were.
Abbot Monreale was apparently celibate, etc., etc.<br>
<br>
Given "all true wealth is biological", really, a happy ending that
consisted of the main character crowing alone atop a big pile of
cash, or bodies, or whatever his solipsistic goal, would seem
peculiarly unsatisfying. Riches or revenge are all very well, but
most readers wouldn't want to place them at the top of a hierarchy
of values. Even enhanced bio-social status, the primary goal of the
protagonists in most coming-of-age tales, requires a context of
other people to exist and be meaningful.<br>
<br>
So the greatest reward for any character's struggles is usually
found in another human or humans. (Or, in F&amp;SF, sympathetic
other sentient being.) The payoff might be romantic or sexual,
embodied in an individual or other configuration, it might be
achieving or saving a family, or becoming part of a team or making
good friends. Or just showing one's doubters what-for. Lots and
lots of ways to play it.<br>
<br>
But for true realism in the end, if one follows any character out
far enough, what they end up as is dead. And the greater the
happiness, the more devastating that final truncation of it, as
Cordelia and Oliver found. All happy endings are ultimately an
illusion created by stopping short. (Or by jumping to a new point
of view, I suppose, navigating nimbly away from death after some
next-generation fashion.)<br>

edition from Spectrum is legit, and you are fine with it. The audio
edition from Blackstone and Audible is also properly licensed.<br>
<br>
However, earlier this month (Feb. 2016) some scammer put out a
shoddy print-on-demand edition through Amazon's self-publishing
arm, CreateSpace, which is just the e-book grepped and put through
the system. This PoD paper edition is stolen. I don't know how many
copies the scammers have managed to shift so far.<br>
<br>
My agent is working on getting attention from Amazon to get it
taken down, so I expect it to disappear in due course, with luck
before too many more readers are taken in.<br>
<br>
Later this year, there will be a legitimate paper edition from
Subterranean Press, which will be a very nice hardcover chapbook --
I just saw a preview of the cover art, which is striking. More
announcements on that as things get finalized.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, please do not purchase the CreateSpace print-on-demand
version. If you have bought it in error, Amazon does make returns
easy (I've returned a couple of book purchases myself, for printing
glitches.) "I found out this edition was stolen" is a good reason
for a return, I would think. Send it back and recover your
money.<br>

<br>
I just read Penric's Demon (my only Five Gods book so far), and
loved it. My question is related to gender and sexuality. There are
several indications in the book that Pen, so far a straight youth,
is starting to find men attractive under the influence of Desdemona
(particularly Rusillin). Is it possible that Pen will end up
becoming bisexual, and Desdemona in turn a bi-gendered, bisexual
demon? <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Insofar and as
long as the two remain separate, what they are going to have is a
perpetual argument. What practical compromises they eventually work
out are at this point unknown.<br>
<br>
(Pen's noticing of Rusillin was not attraction, but worried
jealousy, btw. He was unconsciously afraid Des might like the more
powerful man better.)<br>
<br>
Demons don't have a sex; Des is no more whatever-sexual than "she"
is horse-sual or lion-sual. One might argue that demons perform
gender, I suppose. But all these 12 layers of experience are
imprinted upon her, and simultaneously available to her multiplex
personality. That said, demons do have an appetite for experiencing
the physical through their human (or animal) hosts.<br>
<br>
It is unknown if a demon could end up, however temporarily, in a
tree or plant. That would certainly be their last choice, if
so.<br>

Judging from the book's reviews, about 20% of my readers would cry
"Noes!" to your last question. But in fact, I don't know what will
interest me next. I think I'm due for a long stint of general

This literary universe goes off in all directions, as far as the
eye can see... I, alas, do not stretch that far. I have at this
time no idea what I'm going to write next, if anything; right now I
think I'm due for new input, but such can only go into my brain so
fast before memory formation can't keep up.<br>
<br>
When I look at the knowledge glut available to me here-and-now, I
feel as though I've been taken into a giant grocery store and told
I have to eat all the food on the shelves. Just... can't... do
it...<br>

Hi Carol --<br>
<br>
No, I don't have any more formal signings scheduled at this time.
(Hence no current listing, it being a null set.) If I acquire any,
I'll post the info on my Goodreads blog.<br>

For readers who just want signed copies or, with some extra
waiting, signed and personalized, Uncle Hugo's Science Fiction
Bookstore here in Minneapolis keeps most of my titles signed in

I am the person least qualified to answer this, I suspect. A recent
reviewer suggested the two Cordelia books followed by <i>Gentleman
Jole</i> would make a good trilogy, and I concur, whether as
refreshment or first-read. Prior references to Jole are scattered
in <i>The Vor Game</i>, <i>Cryoburn</i> (brief -- four words -- but
extremely significant, if one thinks about it), and <i>Captain
Vorpatril's Alliance</i>, but I'm not sure they're necessary.<br>
<br>
But -- I say again, probably fruitlessly -- <i>Gentleman Jole</i>
is also readable as a stand-alone, complete in this kit, batteries
included. A reader doesn't <i>have</i> to have read any other
Vorkosigan book, or, indeed, any other Bujold book, to read this
one.<br>
<br>
(The two reasons to turn aside are if said new reader is planning
to read the others, and doesn't want spoilers (although there would
still be plenty of surprises), or if the reader is one of those
strongly averse to finding romance in their SF.)<br>
<br>
So, short version: stand-alone, or the Cordelia Trilogy.<br>
<br>

I don't actually know the answer to this question. I've certainly
seen feedback from almost every conceivable F&amp;SF-reading
demographic, but I don't know what proportions they fall in. I've
had fan mail from readers aged 11 to 84.<br>
<br>
Family, and domesticity generally, tend very much to be spurned in
these genres, certainly as positive portrayals or central subjects.
I have a theory that this has its roots in SF-as-bildungsroman,
where the primary psychological work of the protagonist (and of the
identifying reader) is of <i>separation</i> from the family in
order to achieve adult autonomy. Romance is the psychological
opposite, the work of recreating the family, hence the often-seen
antagonism between the two modes. So is romance or the private
sphere felt as a threat to that autonomy, rather than its fruition?
Good question for a paper, I think. (Not written by me.)<br>
<br>
So, yeah, in my search for story ideas that aren't the same as the
stories everyone else is writing, these themes recognizing the
domestic are certainly under-explored ground.<br>
<br>
Mind you, my original thinking was not so developed. It ran more to
something like, "It seems as if every other hero or heroine is an
orphan. Let's give <i>my</i> guy a family he can't so
narrative-conveniently escape, and then see what happens..."<br>

I expect lactation in the Vorkosiverse is a matter of choice; the
hormones etc. could certainly be made to sit up and behave if
personal lactation was wanted (by any gender, actually), with the
tech shown. As yet another alternative, vat-created human breast
milk would also be feasible. Different places and times would
pursue different fads. In all, more choices, more conscious
decisions for the poor beleaguered parent.<br>
<br>
(I have had occasion to reflect that the female mammalian body is
actually a device for filtering nutrition from the environment
through to the next generation, both pre- and postpartum.
Evolution, so strange...)<br>

I am no gardener myself, but we may assume it was a mix of local
native and imported plants -- the planet, while new, has still had
40 years for people to find some things that work. People were
probably transplanting the things they liked to look at to the
places they wanted to look within 15 minutes of arrival (and making
a few mistakes, too.) I expect she gave thought to not letting
invasive species loose. (Well, apart from her fellow humans.)<br>
<br>
The Gridgrad area was a newer local ecosystem for settlement, so
would take a bit more research, but even there, there were people
there before her.<br>

Well, if I'm speaking to prospective readers one-on-one, I usually
ask them a few questions about their reading preferences, and take
them into account. Do they prefer fantasy or SF? Love or loathe
romance tropes? Like mysteries? War stories? Coming-of-age tales,
or older heroes? Prefer male or female protagonists? Want a long
series or a stand-alone? Are they spoiler sensitive or don't care?
Etc.<br>
<br>
Long general answer is here:<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=

https://www.goodreads.com/story/show/...</a><br>
<br>
Short answer is <i>Shards of Honor</i> for the SF, <i>The Curse of
Chalion</i> for fantasy, <i>The Sharing Knife, Vol. 1:
Beguilement</i> for fantasy/romance, or <i>The Spirit Ring</i> for
a stand-alone with a YA vibe. That cuts it down to 4; flip a coin
twice if nothing jumps out at you. Some of these books have been
around for a long time, and I hope will continue to be so. They'll
wait for you to catch up. The only wrong choice would be not to
read any.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

ebook boxed set/s of the Vorkosiverse? I read many but not all of
them years ago, and find myself wishing I could fill in the blanks.
After finishing your latest (fantastic btw) I realized I'd love to
just reread the series. I'd be very interested in an ebook box set
or two with those spiffy new covers you showed recently.</a></div>

No such plans at this time.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I actually see the point of e-boxed sets, when all the
e-titles of a series are equally and simultaneously e-available.
For paper books, boxed sets circumvent book vendors' maddening
habit of not having all the books, or the earlier books, available
on the shelves simultaneously, so that anyone's attention that is
caught, say, by Book #4 is thwarted from starting at the beginning
and so doesn't start at all. E-vendors, with their infinite virtual
shelf space, don't have that problem in the first place,
thankfully.<br>
<br>
So any reader can fill in the blanks any time, in any order, a la
carte.<br>
<br>
E-boxed sets, which are in effect e-omnibuses, have the opposite
problem of readers complaining that they'd bought such-and-such a
title previously, and why should they have to pay for it twice, or
the worse one of mistaking the omnibus for a new title, ditto. I
think it's safer just to put all the books out as coherently as
possible (hence the new e-cover treatments), and let readers choose
for themselves.<br>
<br>
For reading order and the Did-I-get-them-all? questions, there's

Wondering how Ma Kosti is doing? Retired & spoiling grandchildren

since she got shares for her expert butter bug recipes ... how rich
might she now be? (Her own cooking show vids)? <a class=

Another job for Fanficwoman, but if one posits Ma Kosti was no
older than about 50 when we first meet her, she could easily have a
20-year career at VK House before she started to slow down too
much, or even more if she spent most of her later time directing
and teaching her minions. Since being a Ma Kosti minion would in
due course have been recognized as a great way to launch a
high-level cooking career in Vorbarr Sultana, minions would not be
in short supply.<br>
<br>
Cooking show vids would indeed not be out of the question. She's a
shrewd woman and doing well, but wise enough not to give up the
actual cooking, which is her art, for money management, which is a
mere necessary chore. But, really any woman with four kids and some
unknown number of grandchildren would have no trouble finding ways
to dispose of excess money, or having it disposed of for her.<br>
<br>
I think she ends up with a quite balanced life.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>That story has
always been backstory. I never had plans to expand it, aside from
the bit I added in <i>Gentlemen Jole and the Red Queen</i> during
the conversation on the visit to the <i>Prince Serg</i>, which was
more about history, and a comment on how our picture of the world
changes and becomes less simple as we learn more about it, which
was a running theme through that whole book. I have so far only
seen one review which understood the full implications of that
scene, though.<br>
<br>
I've done a couple of in-series prequels with Miles.
(<i>Barrayar</i> doesn't quite count because about the first third
was written as part of the initial draft of <i>Shards of Honor</i>,
then set aside for several years.) I find them rather constraining,
as instead of just fitting into the series at one end, they have to
fit at both ends, which restricts the development of the story-line
and especially the growth of the characters. And then there's the
question of why characters in later books written earlier never
think about the events of the prequel, which restricts things even
further.<br>
<br>
This would be less of an issue with a deep backstory story, I
suppose. But I am currently quite tired of war stories. And the
bookstore shelves are crammed with them already. There is no
shortage; I don't need to spend my limited time making more of the
same. Books <i>used</i> to be able to be about something else, I'm
pretty sure. I'd prefer to explore in that direction, or some path
even less traveled.<br>

read in Jo Walton's review of Falling Free that it was originally

you care to comment on why that didn't happen, and what you had

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Mostly, I
think, Miles happened. I had some vague plans for more, but the
next thing I tackled was <i>Brothers in Arms</i>, and after that
one thing led to another. By the time I reached a point where I
might circle back and pick it up again, the material had gone
pretty cold, and I wanted to do something new. (Which I eventually
did, with <i>The Curse of Chalion</i>.) Sending Miles and Ekaterin
to Quaddiespace in <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i> was my substitute,
and gave me as much closure as I wanted.<br>
<br>
Properly, following the Escape from Pharaoh should have come the 40
Years in the Wilderness followed by the Conquest of Caanan, i.e.,
the passage to the future Quaddiespace, and the initial building of
the asteroid colony. But that spaceship has sailed.<br>
<br>
Looking back, I think I picked my projects not by plot or even
character, but by themes I found psychologically interesting or
resonant in any given year. Or whatever book I write wraps around
that resonance as it goes, and allows it to embody itself. (It's
far from a linear process.)<br>

<br>
This, yes. I think this was most clear to me with Cryoburn, but
afterward, I realized how the A and B plots (etc, etc) of your
books will circle around a similar set of themes. It made my next
reread of the series a little more insightful, trying to identify
what those themes were.<br>
<br>
Though considering my favorite has always been Memory, I'm a little
surprised it took me so long to realize this.</span>

planet Komarr is being terraformed. I dream of a future when we
terraform Mars. Recently, it's occurred to me the Moon might be a
better choice. Mars is so cold, and the Moon is just the right
distance from the Sun. Since we found ice in a moon crater, we've
got a start on the essential ingredient. Maybe we could snag a
comet for additional water. Do you think humans might do this in
the future?</a></div>

gravity to hold a free atmosphere is a problem for both worlds, the

the seasonal affective disorders would be fierce. (Although
Antarctica once had dinosaurs, so if global warming keeps going,
who knows.) Colonies on either the moon or Mars would probably have
to have enclosed arcologies like Komarr, for starters. The future
is a long time; I wouldn't rule out anything, but I don't see it
happening in the near future, for reasons of economics, biology,

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I keep bashing
this in the head, but the same rumor keeps surfacing; I have
concluded that the fanfic tale is the story people <i>want</i> to
be true. And there are more of them than there are of me, so.<br>
<br>
There is just enough of a grain of truth under this that I can't
deny it outright, but the real story is rather more complex.<br>
<br>
The Vorkosiverse actually got its proto-start in the very first
novelette that I wrote, "Dreamweaver's Dilemma", back in late 1982.
It never sold at the time. (Later, it was printed in the Boskone SF
convention souvenir collection <i>Dreamweaver's Dilemma</i> when I
was GoH there in the mid-90's, and again in my little e-collection
<i>Proto Zoa</i> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.amazon.com/Proto-Zoa-Lois-McMaster-Bujold-ebook/dp/B006T10LK8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1461605668&amp;sr=1-1">
http://www.amazon.com/Proto-Zoa-Lois-...</a> ) Beta Colony and the
Wormhole Nexus generally got its (somewhat off-stage) start in that
tale, plus the history of jump ships, the initial colonization
diaspora from Earth, etc. Barrayar did not yet exist.<br>
<br>
Scratching around for what to write next, in December of 1982, I
bethought me of a TOS scenario that I had made up to entertain
myself while driving to work at OSU Hospitals at least five years
prior. Which was, indeed, a female Federation officer and a Klingon
captain (pre-ridged-rubber-heads; these were the old-style
fuzzy-eyebrows morph) down on a hostile wilderness planet who had
to cooperate to trek I-don't-remember-where for
I-don't-remember-why; the mental movie was never written down.
There was no more to it. Whether or not this long-vanished train of
thought qualifies as "fanfic" seems to me a question for debate. By
someone other than me.<br>
<br>
Walking around behind the notion of Klingons to the actual
historical Earth militaristic cultures upon which they were based,
I considered both European and Asian models, especially the
samurai. A key work under this (besides a 3-volume history of early
Japan I'd read back-when, and a history of the Meiji era) was <i>A
Daughter of the Samurai</i> (1928) by Etsu Inagaki Sugimoto, a
memoir of a woman who was born just prior to the Meiji era as the
daughter of a rural two-sword samurai, and who ended teaching
Japanese at an eastern American university in the 1920's. The
notion of a planet with that sort of abrupt generational
socio-political transition came from that reading. Lost colonies
being an SF staple, one with such a traumatic rediscovery yielded
my Barrayar pretty quickly. It slotted very neatly into my wormhole
diaspora background from the novelette, Aral's boots appeared in
the mud in front of Cordelia's nose, and the rest was, so to speak,
future history.<br>
<br>
Note that the rest of the series, not to mention the rest of that
book, was not yet in my mind: just getting to the end of My First
Novel quite filled my plate. (Working title <i>Mirrors</i>, final
title <i>Shards of Honor</i> (1986))<br>

quick thanks for all the lovely stories, particularly those from
the Vorkosigan saga, that've kept me enthralled the last few years.
Ran through "Dreamweaver's Dilemna" yesterday and I had to ask:
Have you read Asimov's "Dreaming is a Private Thing" by any chance?
If so, was that an inspiration, conscious or otherwise? Two stories
that go in very different directions, obviously, but the core idea
is similar.</a></div>

Vorkosigan series does seem to have this property that I've dubbed
"spawning fractal sequels". Any number of my minor (and major)
characters seem to have lives that extend off the edges of the
pages, and implied stories of their own. I do not have the ability
to spawn fractal clones of myself to write them, alas. (And if I
did, the clones might just as well prefer to go off and do
something else altogether; see, "Mark".) So, no hope there. I'm
afraid you all will have to use your own imaginations for
these.<br>

Patrick O'Brian, Terry Pratchett, and Vladimir Nabokov. In general

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, that's
some fine and varied company!<br>
<br>
How much I work on my sentences consciously at the micro-level
varies. Some scenes just flow out, others have to be squeezed. I
spend a lot more time these days (because I have more time, and
working paperless makes it easier) combing through my paragraphs
winkling out small glitches like word-echoes or less-than-ideal
sentence construction or syntax, or improving word-choices.
(Sometimes, I get it right the first time :-) Sometimes I have to
use bracketing fire to get my range.)<br>
<br>
But mostly I'm just recording the movie in my head, "I write what I
see", well, with added sensory data to the visual when I think of
it. No movie, no words, though, as there is nothing yet to
describe. So my writing sessions tend to come in little bursts of
ideation, captured in notes, as I work out the progress of each
scene (or half-scene.)<br>
<br>
My more detailed creation tends to come in scene-chunks, that being
about all my brain can handle at one time. Paragraphs are
interesting in their own right, structurally and otherwise, and can
be almost like little prose-poems. Big blocks of text or just three
words, or one, depending on the work they're being called on to do.
Every paragraph should move forward internally, placing the reader
at a slightly different place at the end than they were at the
beginning. (Or sometimes a very different place, see, three
words.)<br>

For simple question, this one is surprisingly hard to answer. For
one thing, I would have to <i>remember</i> all my books at the same
time. But as a rule of thumb, characters who have the most books
over which to develop will have the most stage-time to deliver
surprises. Miles, as so often, takes the lead here. (Although, for
a one-book character, Wencel Horseriver was pretty
obstreperous.)<br>

listen to anything and read (or write) at the same time, so no.
That said, music has occasionally been an inspiration or aid to my

songs of Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer were a boost.<br>

Other things at random. Since my kids moved out, I've not been as
much exposed to new music, so I'm rather out of touch. I don't
drive enough to get much in the car, either. (Also the hearing loss
in my right ear combined with the road noise (combined, not
infrequently, with unclear recordings or delivery of lyrics) makes
it an aggravating frustration to even try.)<br>

I wrote that tale back in 1986, and I can't actually remember what
I had for breakfast last week...<br>
<br>
That said, my first notes for the story envisioned a camp rather
more like the ones I'd seen in WWII movies. I certainly wanted
something more SFnal; not sure when I made the switch-over, but it
was pretty early in the notes stage, before I'd started actual
composition. Force domes, walls, whatever, had been tossed into my
VK story mix before then, so it was just a matter of scaling
up.<br>
<br>
That plus, as an introvert who likes solitude, I could imagine
nothing more dire than being trapped somewhere with a crowd of
10,000 people and not being able to get away from them to be by
myself. (And no books, argh.) Miles dealt with it rather better
than I would have.<br>

Lois, you just said in an answer that as an introvert, you would
have hated being under the dome, but that Miles did okay. Does that
mean he's an extrovert? And while we're on the topic of
personalities, can you tell us what your and his Hogwarts houses
are? Or Myers-Briggs type, if you prefer that?</a></div>

Hogwarts or Myers-Briggs, sorry. You all are welcome to have a go

<br>
Yes, I think Miles is an extrovert, energized rather than drained
by engagement with other people. He can deal perfectly well with
solitude for short stretches, but then he needs action. I am the
reverse.<br>

though. Nowhere in either Penric story or "Hallowed Hunt" Is
Chalion mentioned (that I can find), although some other countries
like Ibra and Darthica are. Is this because Chalion was too obscure
back then, or did Chalion actually not exist that much earlier than
Cazaril's time?</a></div>

you give GG a pronunciation guide? Some words are pronounced
differently in different audio books and sometimes in the same book
- Dendarii, Galeni, Radovas, Ky, etc. Any hints? Is By bi? Do you
think Richars was the one who lied to By's father about him? Do you
know the names of Cordelia's other 4 girls like she does?</a></div>

(the Blackstone Audiobooks narrator) has in recent years often
called me on the phone before starting a project to check
pronunciations. In the earliest works he recorded, we hadn't yet
made that connection, so the pronunciations are inconsistent over
recording dates.<br>
<br>
By is bi, although it's uncertain how much of that is situational
with respect to his (old) ImpSec job. The occasional over-the-top
swishiness is <i>mostly</i> an act, to mislead or annoy people.<br>
<br>
I don't know who lied to By's dad about By and his sister. Richars
would be an interesting and plausible candidate, certainly. If so,
it's quite possible By never found out, or at least not at the
time; equally possible that he eventually did.<br>
<br>
No, I don't know the names of Cordelia's other 4 girls. I had some
notes somewhere. I know she'd wanted Simone, but then Miles nipped
in and grabbed it first, somewhat to Cordelia's annoyance..
"Olivia" is doubly likely, to honor both Aral's mother and Oliver,
though that might be saved for if she and Oliver ever had a girl
together. "Elizabeth", after Cordelia's mom, has also been snapped
up. There are lots of other possibilities, anyway, Alys and Xaviera
among them.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Mark's weight
seems to be one of those things that's better to leave each reader
to imagine for themselves. It varies over time, both up and down,
depending on his current circumstances. But never lower than 2x
Miles, which would be about 200 pounds. More, even much more, is
certainly possible.<br>
<br>
Personally, I suspect Kareen of having a very private and rather
transgressive fetish... but that's between Kareen and Mark. And
their therapists, physicians, and perhaps body-modification
specialists. I expect Vorkosiverse bariatric medicine has all kinds
of tricks for keeping people healthy at any weight that we, alas,
do not, so overweight, or indeed any weight, does not trail the
kind of rather hysterical negative social surround there that it
does here. I'm sure people find other things to be busybodies
about.<br>
<br>
That Mark's overweight freaks Miles is just a delicious bonus, from
Mark's point of view. But that's not about social disapproval, but
rather Miles's own identity, control, and body-image issues when
confronted with this unexpected twin.<br>

Nope, no media adaptations on the horizon at this time.<br>
<br>
The notion that the stories or characters would survive such an
adaptation in any recognizable form seems optimistic to me; my two
prior adventures in that direction certainly didn't. (A short story
adapted to a half-hour show, which was actually produced, back in
the 80s, and a feature film offer in the 90s that only went as far
as a jaw-droppingly dire script.)<br>

That will be up to Blackstone Audiobooks to make an offer.
Subsequently, it would still be some time for the work to move
through production to release, so, not time to hold one's breath
yet.<br>
<br>
Should there be news from that quarter, I'll certainly post it on
my blog.<br>

Komarr recorded in multiple sessions for Audible? I listened to a

I have no idea how Audible does its recordings; you'd have to ask
at Audible or Blackstone, I'm afraid.<br>

Which, since it is also found at the ends of <i>Shards of Honor</i>

don't set a particularly high bar for myself. I try to capture how
I reacted and why without putting in too many spoilers, and offer
something of what I see as the mode or mood of the book for others
considering reading it, but really, they're on their own. The
accumulation here on Goodreads acts as much as a reading diary for
me as anything else, so I can look back and find, "What the heck
was the title/author/what that book was about that I was reading
last year...?"<br>

It's interesting, looking back over a long enough baseline, to see
which books were memorable, and which have settled into the sludge
at the bottom of my memory and dissolved.<br>

should all be available that way. (Or better yet, don't wait, so

The rights to do translations have to be licensed by the publishing
company that plans to bring the book/s out, and they usually hire
their own translators. (Naturally, since a publisher will be
investing considerable up-front resources in this task, which they
hope to make back by sales, they expect their license to be

So, alas, probably not OK unless you represent and are speaking for

<br>
I don't always know how every book will end, no, though I often
have a sort of general target in mind. Exactly how I'll get there
has to be worked out as I write, and the target sometimes shifts in
the process. Inspiration comes to me in visions of scenes or
exchanges or loose bits, which I capture in notes and massage
around till they work right, as each scene comes up. (I almost
always write stories in chronological narrative order, since every
scene written changes the ambit of the possible for what follows,
sometimes incrementally, sometimes by a lot.)<br>
<br>
With <i>Cryoburn</i>, yes, I had the last scene, and indeed the
last line, in mind well before I began the book (years before);
much of the book was me finding my way to it. Yours is pretty much
the reader-response I was aiming to elicit, although readers who
approached the book thinking it was just going to be another
Miles-plot-romp were alas self-confused by their own assumed
reading protocols. A lot of my books tend to repay rereading, where
the reader is at last reading what's actually in front of them,
instead of looking around for some other story.<br>

Yes, I've read some Charles Williams. (Also the rest of his

over the years, from Thomas Merton to St. Augustine to Dorothy

"/questions/858104-hello-lois-i-hope-you-are-doing-well-i">Hello
Lois, I hope you are doing well. I am a big fan of the Vorkosigan
series. I started Curse of Chalion, but did not finish it (this was
many years ago). However, loved the 2 Penric novellas. So, which
one of earlier books is most like Penric, so I can try again? Also,
I think it is great idea to do novellas--it really is a short
novel. Any more Penric novellas coming? Will you collect them in a
real paper edition?</a></div>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Probably the
best book to try is <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i>. It's set in somewhat
the same geographic region as the two Penric tales (well, just
south -- the Weald) maybe 150 years earlier. Note that its hero and
point-of-view character, Ingrey, is something of a
passive-aggressive (as well as actually aggressive) bully-boy to
start out, so riding in his head will demand a drier sense of humor
than sunny Penric.<br>
<br>
I hope to do more with Penric, yes. Can't say when.<br>
<br>
The first two novellas had/will have limited hardcover paper
editions from Subterranean Press, but the print run was/will be
quite small, so they aren't easy to find. Future paper assemblages
or collections must wait on a larger accumulation of stories, which
will take a while. Many ideas, only one brain to process them.
There's a queue.<br>
<br>
I really like novellas, too. Note that they can range, officially,
from 17,500 words, more short-story-like, to 40,000 words at the
cap, which can feel a little more novel-like. I enjoy the tight
focus, the limited, intimate scope, and the fact that they don't
take a year, or four, to write. And I am very interested in the
indie e-pub experiment.<br>

in the Vorkosiverse was settled in "our" time, but rather, two
hundred and more years into our future, when people may be assumed
to have gotten around and mixed and split and recombined right here

languages en route. So a few ethnic names are not really enough to

Vashnoi was the old Vorkosigan's District capital that was nuked
toward the end of the Cetagandan Occupation aka 9th Satrapy. It is
part (center, actually) of all the radioactive land Miles's
grandfather left him.<br>
<br>
For Miles, then, it is a symbol of dying before surrender, the
ultimate Barrayaran stubbornness; he is, as it were, declaring his
ownership of his Barrayaran self, Lord Vorkosigan, not Admiral
Naismith, along with the dream, memory, and remains of the lost
city. No matter how unrewarding that identity may sometimes seem to
him...<br>

I was thinking recently about how much I like the Smart Sidekick
characters (infinitely more than jock heroes, ferex), although I'm
not sure that's a trope, exactly. Smart heroes are good too, when
one can get them. Well-done angsty backstories can lure me in
(badly done ones, not so much), with characters eventually
triumphing over same to earn their happy endings.<br>
<br>
Also a sucker for hurt-comfort, which seems a very female taste. If
anybody can explain this one... I can't, and I <i>share</i> it.<br>
<br>
Guilty pleasures also change over time. At present, anime, manga,
and fanfic seem to top the list. Selectively; I'm pretty picky, now
I've completed the initial discovery/survey phase. Next year, who
knows?<br>

I can answer this one, Each work had its fun parts and its
hair-tearing parts, and over thirty years my memory has turned to
compost anyway. If something isn't any fun, or at least doesn't
speak to me in some gripping way (or, better, both), I can't write
it in the first place.<br>

It is a particular joy, when I have been scratching away at a
stubborn knotty bit, to have the untangling solution fall out of my

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, I always
listen to commentary with interest, because it's a source of
endless fascination to me the wildly varied ways people read and
process the same text. But that's just a kind of mildly masochistic
self-indulgence. Otherwise, I pretty much ignore them. My story, my
characters; if they want to be in charge, they can write their own.
If they want someone to take dictation, they can hire a
stenographer.<br>
<br>
Exceptions are readers with technical expertise in some element
that has come up in the story -- medicine, for example -- who can
give me advice or ideas or prevent me from making gaffes in matters
of fact. Technical expertise can extend to certain characterization
issues sometimes, so as almost always in writing, the boundaries
are fuzzy and the true answer is, It Depends.<br>
<br>
Note that there is also a difference between solicited critique,
before a work is published with the explicit goal of test-driving
it and uncovering flaws, and later commentary, after it's entirely
too late to change anything and anyway the writer has already moved
on to the next project. (If writers treat the latter with the same
attention as the former, they will drive themselves crazy.)<br>

question without an objective answer. A superb reading experience
relies on a complex, interlocking match between a specific reader's
desires, expectations, abilities, and stage of life, and a
particular text, such that even with the same text, each reader
will get a different experience; and even the same reader with the
same text will have a different experience on subsequent rereads.
So there are no "best books", only "best readings", and even the
latter changes as the reader grows, learns, and ages.<br>

it's any tale where one character gets hurt and another has to take
care of him-her-it, forcing a changing and deepening of whatever
emotional relationship between them the author is in pursuit of.
(When the emphasis is more on the hurt part, one sometimes suspects
a touch of authorial sadism, or at least bad mood, but really, it's
mostly a device to peel bare and reveal emotion.)<br>

know, I'm a long-time fan of your books. I've often wondered why
you created two of your major characters with physical
disabilities? I'm referring to Dag in the Sharing Knife books, and
Miles in the Vorkosigan series. The characters have made me think
about the limits of human experience (as well as my own limits.) -

actually answer that, as they both walked on stage as-is, and could
never have been any other way.<br>

So it was never a matter of "I am interested in writing about
disabilities, therefore I will compose these characters to frame
those issues," but rather, "Huh. That's one way to slow him down a
bit. So what is he going to do now? Let's see what happens..."<br>
<br>
The first reader to point out that I was writing about disabilities
actually fastened on the quaddies, whom I did not think of as
handicapped at all, but rather, hyper-adapted -- as long as they
were in the right environment. We had some really interesting early
exchanges on the subject.<br>

I do think they could adapt better to TV than a feature film. But
in any case, the adaptation would be much harder than it looks, as
so much of the appeal of the books depends on the experience they
offer of the insides of people's heads, which visual media cannot
give, and on voice, also lost in translation.<br>

Not least because re-publications typeset in new editions require
the page proofs to be proofread, again, offering an irresistible
chance for a bit more copy-editing. So I reread the whole
Vorkosigan saga for direct e-publication a few years ago, and am
doing so yet again for the new Baen trade paperback editions.<br>

It's a chore that can get really tedious, given enough

Their blurb is a trifle misleading. It's actually 5th only in the
Chalion series; 2nd in the Pen & Des sub-series. I foresee the
usual Bujold-reading-order confusion will continue.<br>

morning! Just wanted to say hello, and mention something a friend
and I were discussing. As we've grown older, fiction has begin to
become less interesting, and the real world has become more and
more fantastical. I'm unsure if this is an effect of age, or if
reality has simply reached a bizarre enough state of technological
advancement that we from the previous state are having trouble
processing it. Thoughts?</a></div>

living in the 21st century now, which was always The Future.
(Granted, it's not the future we ordered or expected.)<br>
<br>
I think the real world has always been pretty fantastical, but in
the Old Days (tm), people could only access a small slice of it.
Due to the internet and other communications technologies, people
are being exposed to way more of it than had even been possible
before, and indeed way more than most of us can process.<br>
<br>
And, yes, they keep making more. This has changed the problem from
that of accessing knowledge that is scant and rare and valuable, a
perpetual state of local famine, to triaging an avalanche of
knowledge. I've likened it to being taken into a huge modern
supermarket, and told one has to eat all the food on the shelves.
Obviously, the old system of trying to know everything about
everything can't work in this new environment. I'm not sure we've
figured out yet what will.<br>

fascinated by the possibilities. I especially like the

work together, which can go so many different directions, from
subtle chemistry (catalyst?) to gross physical manifestations. I
hope this gets explored more.</a></div>

reason, you seem to be noticing the few wider-age-differences
couples preferentially. Miles and Ekaterin, Simon and Alys, Ingrey
and Ijada, Ista and Illvin, Kou and Drou, Fiametta and Thur, Tony
and Claire, Whit and Berry, Iselle and Bergon, and on and on, are
all very close in age. Anyone's guess on Aral and Cordelia, given
the different expected lifespans. And a sprinkling of others in
that decade-ish range -- Gregor and Laisa, Ivan and Tej, Alys and
Padma for that matter.<br>
<br>
It's a figure-ground effect. I suppose. The figure always seems to
stand out from the ground, even or especially when the ground is
larger.<br>

My family is small, and so does not offer a wide range of samples;
friends, a few, but they are relatively rare, as they are in my

Readers have all kinds of ideas for things for me to write, far
more than any writer could get around, and this is normal. But my
real job is to figure out what <i>I</i> want to write. I'm afraid
it's not apocalypses, and any development on that potential lies

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>There are many
how-to-write sources -- I usually recommend Pat Wrede's blog, for
starters: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/">http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/</a><br>
<br>
<i>Why</i> to write is a different question. It is perfectly
possible to write for oneself, for one's own pleasure -- in fact,
that pretty much has to underlie all other goals, or one might just
as well be flipping burgers for a living, or doing something else
more reliable to get the desired attention or validation. After
that initial joy-in-creation, further ambitions are up to the
individual, and can vary wildly according to taste.<br>
<br>
As a cart-horse-protocol observation, it is generally necessary to
write something before one gets or grows an audience for it,
although one does sometimes see people trying to do it the other
way around. A friend of mine describes those as "people who want to
have written." Not recommended.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, there are lots of ways to reinvent one's own life,
especially necessary for older women, as we tend to lack
satisfactory standard social role models for actually, like, still
being alive when older. If you ever get to Ista's book, <i>Paladin
of Souls</i>, it addresses some of those issues. (Note it is a
sequel to <i>The Curse of Chalion</i>, however.)<br>

"/questions/918300-in-your-five-gods-stories-you-use-the">In your
"five gods" stories, you use the word "vail" as a noun in a way
that implies a gratuity or emolument, but the only definition I can
find suggests its usage was as a verb, meaning to show submission
or respect, typically by removing a hat. How did you come by your
usage of this word?</a></div>

Anyway, it's not up to me. Print rights are held by HarperCollins,
who may do with them as they wish. In general, paper reprints of
older books are only financially feasible if it's done in
coordination with release of a new frontlist novel, and sometimes
not even then.<br>
<br>
Right now -- I just checked -- you can buy the original hardcover
editions of all three titles used starting at a penny plus postage
on Amazon. (For rather more, you can buy unused ones signed from
Uncle Hugo's Science Fiction Bookstore here in Minneapolis.) This
is not something a publisher can compete with, for small-demand
items.<br>

write by hand, do you type, do you use dictation technology or a

you have a fan at CBS? Scorpion had an exploding lake, a la Lake
Lethal, Pure Genius had a lab working on an artificial womb, and
Elementary had an episode about vat meat. I'm confused about the
name Mia Maz - is Mia her first name or a title, like miss? Miles
calls her milady Maz and she says "just Maz" Is it easier/harder to
write from multiple POVs? I find I like the extra takes, tho Memory
is a masterpiece</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, vat meat
and artificial wombs are standard SF genre furniture for a long
time, and Lake Lethal was based on a real lake in the Cameroons --
the writers may have read the same article in <i>Scientific
American</i> that I did.<br>
<br>
Still, it would be nice to think that I had fans in the media
world.<br>
<br>
Mia is Mia Maz's first name. It may be customary in her culture to
go by one's last name, except perhaps for intimate friends, but in
the instance quoted she's telling him not to use the "milady", as
that isn't a title she has. Yet.<br>
<br>
Multiple POVs versus single-viewpoint aren't necessarily harder or
easier, they just present a different set of challenges. What
matters is if the viewpoint/s chosen and the plot play well
together. My viewpoint characters tend to wrap their plots around
themselves, which risks the plot galloping off in all directions
unless variously controlled.<br>

first two Chalion novels include maps, but only of the Ibran
peninsula where those books take place. I didn't make more than a
penciled note-sketch map for <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> (though you
can think "medieval Germany" as a shorthand for the Weald), nor for
the Penric tales so far. (Though you can think "medieval
Switzerland" for the first two stories.) Don't go overboard trying
to draw parallels with our-world history and geography, though. The
inspirations are fluid.<br>
<br>
Or, I see, we have the Ibran maps up at dendarii.com --<br>

<br>
<br>
My nonfiction e-book <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i> has iirc
one or two earlier pieces that address the Five Gods Universe. Or
there might be something in the mass of author interviews also
linked at the wiki, but heaven knows where. Anything
Chalion-pertinent would likely have been done around 2001 -
2005.<br>
<br>
For other stories in that universe you'd likely want to start with
<i>The Curse of Chalion</i> -- the author's note in the back of the
Penric e-novellas has more particulars.<br>

"/questions/941906-recently-reread-both-capt-v-sa-and-gjatrq">Recently
reread both Capt V'sA and GJatRQ. Started speculating that the trip
Miles went on just after meeting Tej may have been the trip in
Cryoburn. However, that would put Aral's death somewhere very soon
before/after the sinking of Impsec. So I tried using Helen's age,
as stated in Cryoburn and GJ...and I don't think those work,
either. In Cryoburn, Miles says the twins are 5; in GJ, they're 11.
Help?</a></div>

may end up being something like the location of Watson's wound, I'm
afraid. You can close much of any perceived gap by positing
5-almost-6 and just-turned-11.<br>
<br>
<i>Cryoburn</i> takes place approximately 4 years after<i>Captain
Vorpatril's Alliance</i>. The trip Miles take in <i>CVA</i> is
Gregor's follow-up to the Sergyaran weapons theft.<br>
<br>
There is also the open question of how long is a year, as each
planet is different. Even more brain-bending is the question of
what time means on opposite sides of a wormhole jump, but I
prudently do not go there.<br>

that the SFWA ruling is not theirs, and that fans may nominate the
book as usual per its hardcover first publication date of February
2016, i.e., for this year's Helsinki Worldcon.<br>

that was my 2008 Denvention Worldcon speech. Alas, after ten years,
I know longer remember how I was going to develop that

<br>
It probably had something to do with the notion about how show
breeds are over-bred to the point where they are no longer
functional as dogs, parallel to how genre stories get over-selected
during popular trends till they are no longer functional as
stories. But the speech was already plenty long, and trends die on
their own, like algae blooms, if, it sometimes seems, not soon
enough. (Dystopias, *cough*.)<br>

Yep, teratomas are deeply weird. But at least reasonably well
understood, nowadays. (That poor Chalionese proto-oncologist was
really struggling.)<br>
<br>
The weirdest fictional treatment of a teratoma I have yet run
across was from the <i>Black Jack</i> mangas. Which are from
bizarro-land even by the standards of manga.<br>

watching Building Great Sentences by The Great Courses. It's
diverting, but some illustrations leave my head spinning. My
question is... when writing a first draft, do you consider sentence
construction (cumulative vs periodic vs other structures) or do you
simply put the story out, to be revised later. Do your sentences
find their final structure instinctively or are they nudged into
shape later on?</a></div>

I do revise while writing, but it's so practiced by now that I
hardly have to think about it. The unit-of-attention is more the
paragraph than the sentence, however, as its shape drives what the
sentences within it need to be. Sentences don't exist in isolation,
after all. (Well, not in prose fiction.) Beyond that, what I
consider the real work-unit for me is the scene. I usually need to
have the whole scene blocked out before I can start writing.<br>
<br>
I have a visual imagination. First I have to think of the
picture/movie of what I'm trying to get down; then, when it is
fairly clear in my mind and captured in rough notes, the words to
describe it follow, floating up out of wherever they are assembled
in my brain. Some of this happens as part of outlining, some later.
It feels spontaneous at this stage, but it's actually not, as it
doesn't happen without a great deal of pre-writing thought/work.
Tidying the words follows that. (It could hardly precede it, after
all.)<br>
<br>
The amount of tidying needed varies. (Sometimes, I get it right the
first time!) Micro-editing tends to include winkling out word
echoes, unknotting less-than-ideal syntax, and improving word
choice. When I change the actual events being described, I no
longer consider it micro-editing, but most of that gets done at the
prior scene-outline stage.<br>
<br>
I do some nudging on the fly as I write, some later on during one
of the many rereads. If the story is flowing out hot, I pause
less.<br>

No other Serg offspring, although the Escobar mess offers

fangirling - I discovered the Vorkosigan Saga a while back and I
adore it, thank you so much. To business - I'm an aspiring writer
currently at the end of editing my first draft manuscript. Since
I've decided to try the traditional publishing route first, I'm
currently starting the search for an agent and the whole process
is, frankly, terrifying. How did you find / settle on your
agent?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Re: agents, I
went at it backwards. I had sold/published several books starting
in the mid-80s without one, began to learn my way around a bit,
took advice from a few writer friends, contacted my agent of
choice, and we first met and shook hands in New York on Nebula
Weekend, 1989. Still with each other. This is not a route that is
really available nowadays, so my experience is useless for new
writers.<br>
<br>
My go-to book-or-blog for new writers is Pat Wrede's: <a target=
"_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/">http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/</a> or
her blog e-book, <i>Wrede on Writing</i>. She only has a little to
say about agent hunting, but what she does offer is sensible and
sound.<br>
<br>
Start with what Pat has to say, and look over what other advice you
can find -- there will be tons, not all of it good -- and after
that, I'm afraid, you are on your own.<br>
<br>
Terrifying and depressing, yeah. This is normal. Sorry I can't be
more help --<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(I should add, if your agent search does not prosper, Kristine
Katherine Rusch's blog used to have some informed advice on how to
do without one. But she is very experienced, so I'm not sure how
much of what she advises can really be emulated by a
newbie.)</span></div>

will be any foreign translations of the Penric tales until there
are enough to collect in a commercially saleable novel-sized
volume, or a couple of them. Which is going to be a while. It's not
viable for the publisher otherwise.<br>
<br>
No, you may not do it yourself, because it would screw up the later
possibility of an actual sale. (Except, I suppose, privately, for
your own consumption. Another of those don't-ask-don't-tell
things.)<br>
<br>
If there are professional translators for self-published e-books,
done presumably as work-for-hire, it's not a part of the e-business
I'm plugged into yet. It would be extremely demanding for the
original author to try to work across many language platforms, with
people one does not know; that's part of the service an actual
foreign publisher provides. (At no cost to the author.) Better to
spend one's time and brain-budget writing a new work.<br>

I am fond of Megan Whalen Turner's alternate-Greece-ish series
starting with <i>The Thief</i>, and Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of
London urban fantasy, first book <i>Rivers of London</i>, retitled
<i>Midnight Riot</i> in its US release.<br>
<br>
I have also been drawn into the manga/anime from CLAMP titled
<i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, which has an obligate
narrative interlock with their other series <i>xxxHolic</i>. One
can spend many, many hours trying to figure out wtf is going on
with the plot/s, but it's the characters that induce me to
bother.<br>
<br>
Just for starters.<br>

Anyone else have some faves?<br>

alone, but there were several logic problems with that potential
plot development. For one, it would have required the science crew
that <i>Cordelia had hired</i> to track the course of the
underlying magma to be entirely incompetent at their jobs.
Overstretched they may be; but they are not useless ditzes. This is
a millennium in "our" future; we must also posit that volcano
predictions are much improved over the benighted 21st Century, just
as health care and space travel are.<br>
<br>
Also, on the literary level, it would have required a coincidence
of plot timing of the sort I have been much criticized-for, in the
past.<br>
<br>
Much more importantly, on the literary level, it would have proved
an interruption to the story I was telling, not a part of the story
I was telling.<br>

Is there a map of the World of the Five Gods that also includes the

mentioned that Chalion and Ibra are loosly based on the Iberian

kind of imagine that Weald is somewhere around Germany, and Cedonia

Cedonia is vaguely Greece and Italy munged together. This world
lacks an Italian peninsula as such, although I posit a chain of
islands in their place.<br>
<br>
I have not yet devised a map for this region, as I haven't finished
making it up yet. Stories have to pass through to call their
landscapes into existence.<br>
<br>
The Weald as an inverted sort-of Germany is correct, and Penric's
native cantons are vaguely Swiss. Further correspondences may or
may not happen, depending on my tales' needs for pre-fab
world-building. People should not get too carried away with
matching games; this is not historical fiction with the serial
numbers filed off, for all that I may use dismembered bits of
history as plausible (or, sometimes, completely incredible, because
history offers a lot of no-one-could-make-this-up moments)
jumping-off points.<br>

formal venue of the Residence, classical, waltz 'n schmaltz, rather
military march-ish when they want to liven the dance up. Think
Russian folk dances, also. (Interesting speculation what Gregor
listens to when by himself, on his Imperial headphones, but I bet
it's not more of that.)<br>
<br>
What Barrayaran popular music generally consists of,
post-Time-of-Isolation, is another question, with a much more
varied answer, especially over a century of time. Marching bands
not-military are a thing mentioned, and competitions for same,
leading to really complicated drills (and trills.) We've seen folk
music by actual folk, up in the Dendarii Mountains, at least. Plus
all those galactic influences and fads pouring in, mixing things
up. I expect the music scene on Barrayar is very lively and much
debated/argued-about. Puts me in mind of a character mentioned in,
iirc, the Liavek fantasies, as a celebrated theater critic and
duelist...<br>

I figured the temple designs and decorations should vary by
regions, their climates, building materials, and histories. In the
Ibran peninsula, where temples keep changing hands as the endemic
wars move over them, being able to alter allegiances without having
to tear down the whole building is more parsimonious. Smaller
wooden temples can get away with a pentagonal design, but once one
hits the weight of stone buildings, stresses must be more carefully
balanced, hence 5 sides plus devoted entry = a more even 6. Wooden
carvings where wood is abundant, stone and mosaics and frescoes
where it is not. And so on, as my invention holds up, my stories
meander geographically, and my historical reading matter inspires
or informs (or corrects.)<br>

Never read it, so, no.<br>

As a general rule, readers inclined to the game of "spot the
sources" tend to ascribe influences based on what they know, not on
what the author knows/knew. Academics are possibly the worst
offenders. (Though they can be right twice a day.)<br>

At one time, I had plans in that direction, but the books seriously
failed to materialize. Really, both gods ought to be fraught with
possibilities, but neither seem to be speaking to me. No juice.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I'm finding Penric and Desdemona's slightly more
comic tone to be more congenial. And their shorter lengths way less
daunting and exhausting.<br>

finished all of your Vorkosigan books and I loved them! For the
majority of them I listened to the audio version during my commute
to and from work. There were to items that seem to have changed
pronunciation as the series progressed. Dendarii changed from
den-der-ee, to d den-der-ee-eye. Galeni changed from guh-len-eye to
guh-len-ee. Can you tell me which are the most appropriate? Thanks!

The recordings were made in different orders, some before the
narrator was able to catch up with me for pronunciations. So I'm

First off, praying that your surgery goes well next month! From all
of us I'm sure, please stay safe! My Q is: How do you personally
approach poetry? Specifically, how do you translate your experience
with poetry into your writing? The 5 Gods stuff is sometimes so
stunningly lyrical that I had to wonder. I'm reading Aniara by
Harry Martenson and it made me think of the Cetagandans taking art
to its limits.</a></div>

You'll have to ask the movie makers that question. It's not up to
me.<br>
<br>
(That said, making a movie from my writing would be a lot harder
than it looks at first glance, due to the fact that so much of what
is interesting is going on inside the characters' heads, nearly

Thank you for all the excellent hours of reading over the years. I
really have to force myself to slow down when you have a new
release because it's always bittersweet to wait a year or more for
a book and then finish it in a day. I'm really enjoying penric. I'd
write more, but I have to get to my question. Do you have any

Well, my standard answer to this question lately has been Megan
Whalen Turner and Ben Aaronovitch. In older work, Georgette Heyer
can still be fun. Jennifer Crusie for more contemporary. If you are
looking to widen your scope into manga, some of the works of CLAMP
are pretty good. Some of theirs are misses for me, but the
cross-connected series <i>xxxHolic</i> and <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir
Chronicle</i> really worked for me, eventually, although they take
considerable commitment to unravel. I have a review section up
around here somewhere... ah.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I'm having fun
with them too, although I'm making no promises as to frequency. But
the chance at a lot of variety is enticing. (Of course, for that
one also needs a character who is capable of supporting more than
one sort of story.) Also, for me the beginning of writing a novel
is generally something fresh, and the end is rewarding, but the
middle is a slog. Novellas have a lot less middle.<br>
<br>
The new e-markets have really opened up more potential variety for
story length, as well. In the days of the paper magazines, the
issues couldn't fit in very many novellas. In the more recent years
of publishing, editors needed big bricks so as to be able to
justify the big prices required to cover all their costs. For
original e-books and stories, nothing has to be stretched or padded

Sounds like a job for FanficWoman. Or FanficMan, I suppose.
(Although don't ask, don't tell -- me at least.)<br>
<br>
More seriously, it is a good thing when one's world-building, not
to mention character-building, appears to readers to run past the
edge of the page or the end of the book. It suggests they have
actually become engaged with one's art, which is kind of the
goal.<br>
<br>
To answer your more specific questions, Cordelia and Jole never
marry, although after 20 or more years of it they might as well be,
and neither gets posted off planet (although they may travel)
because they are both very soon out of the sorts of jobs that can
compel such things.<br>
<br>
(Though it does occur to me that their 20th anniversary will be a
strange frisson for Jole, because it will mark the beginning of
more years than he'd been with Aral, and their 40th ditto for
Cordelia. After that it's <i>Sergyar Incognita</i> for both.)<br>

you follow any online authors? I enjoy a few, like Drew Hayes, who
post a couple chapters a week from his latest work. Allowing fans
to act as beta readers, before the final polish. Another good one
is Wildbow. Since they write just for online, they aren't
restricted in length and write until the story is told. I think
Worm, (https://parahumans.wordpress.com), is the best one. It's
about equal to 10 books.</a></div>

My paper consumption has varied over the years. In the beginning,
it was a 3-ring notebook and some pencils, a laboriously typed
first draft with two carbons (one for Pat and one for Lillian) and
a final draft ditto (but not dittoed.) I could not afford
photocopying.<br>
<br>
Paper consumption went up as I entered the computer years, and
could print out test readers' copies at will. My agent also needed
two copies of the final, one for the publisher, one to be
photocopied multiple times for foreign submissions and shipped
overseas. So during the 90s, one novel could consume a nearly
10-ream carton of paper, and that was just on my end. Not to
mention keeping the post office busy lugging it all back and
forth.<br>
<br>
Around the turn of the millennium, I started submitting e-files to
Baen, often with a paper copy backup as well. It took a long time
for the supporting paper copies to drop out, as publishers
gradually joined the 20th Century, or rather, old staffers retired
or died and were replaced by newer ones. It's only in the past few
years that my submissions process, including to and by my agent,
has become entirely paperless.<br>
<br>
It's also only in the last few years that my writing has become
paperless. <i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i> was the first
novel I wrote without making a complete running printout, punched
and put in a binder as I went, although I still printed certain
sections for various purposes. So it's only as I reached the Penric
tales that I have started to use no paper at all, except to print
out a section to take to a reading or something.<br>
<br>
My recent galleys have all come as pdf files, too. It took me a bit
to get used to that, but I've converted now. (It probably also
helps a lot that I now have less unwieldy computers with better
screens to read them on. My new Lenovo X1 Yoga is downright
addictive. It does splendid things for manga.) Don't underestimate
the impact the improvements in reading devices have had on
fostering all this.<br>
<br>
So on my end, a case of paper has dropped to a fraction of a ream,
over the past... urk, it can't be 20 years...?<br>
<br>
At my last move, three years ago, I donated a whole packed bedroom
of manuscripts, paper files and whatnot to the collection at
Northern Illinois University; better them than me. I lugged all
that stuff after me for years, and I <i>so</i> don't miss it
now.<br>

Not as relayed, no. But I have mixed in trying to improve my covers
from time to time, and it has never helped. I mostly don't try
anymore.<br>

I am more relaxed about it all in these later days, when I no

that <i>Paladin of Souls</i> one in Britain, but I gave up on the

about the middle of the first draft of <i>Shards of Honor</i>, and
2) yes, the misnamed "bugs", horned hoppers, some unnamed sea life
on the shore of Kyril Island, other bits along the way. Alas,
nothing big and exciting like Barrayaran were-tigers or anything.
The vegetation gets described repeatedly.<br>
<br>
At one point, very early on in the story development, I'd toyed
with the idea of an alien contact/invasion to keep my two
protagonists working together but apart for the second half of the
book, but the Barrayaran war idea worked much better, more
intrinsically. I was also interested in exploring the
bioengineered-future all-the-aliens-were-us trope. The Barrayar
stories give a snapshot of that very long-range project just
begining.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Four different
UK book publishers over two decades failed to sell my books to
their satisfaction (or mine). The last-but-one <i>forgot that they
had bought three books from me</i>, and would not have published
them at all except that we prodded them as the license was about to
expire. Just as the line was dying; the editor brought in to
oversee this demise didn't even bother to read them in order to
write cover copy, but just cobbled something together from online
reviews. Sales (once they bothered to print them) were microscopic.
The last publisher dropped my series midway because they failed to
sell enough copies, which they phrased as, the book failed to sell
enough copies.<br>
<br>
That book was <i>Paladin of Souls</i>, winner of the Hugo, Nebula,
and Locus awards for best novel, and a NYTimes bestseller.
Yeah.<br>
<br>
I don't know what's wrong with British publishers versus me, but it
was plain by then that it was nothing I could fix by writing better
or faster or anything else under my actual control to do.<br>
<br>
Happily, my direct-placement e-books have given me a way to route
completely around the UK publishers and book distribution and reach
readers directly. My e-titles on iTunes and Amazon UK have been
selling modestly but steadily since 2011, with no sign of slacking
off. As more UK readers get into e-books, I expect that to
continue.<br>

you seen that book 5 of the Queen's Thief series (Megan Whalen
Turner) is coming out in May? I found out about this series through
you. Also, I don't know if you care for podcasts, but a main
character of the S-town podcast reminded me a bit of Miles if his
life had taken a different tack. It's good listening and I'd love
to know what you think of it should you happen to give it a

with the trope, which has become standard genre furniture, as early

metaphorically, if I recall from my one reading of, good grief,

I have a writer friend with eye problems who is doing a lot of
audiobook listening now, too. At least the offerings are hugely
more abundant these days, with e-downloads.<br>
<br>
At present, I am merely rationing my reading time. (Or should be. I
know I've been overdoing it when I start seeing double through
<i>one</i> eye.) I expect I'll be forced to more self-discipline in
due course. My creative process is very visual and kinesthetic,
seeming to demand written notes and visual feedback; I'm not sure
how much of a stretch trying to put my lagging audio brain into the
loop would be, but I'd need to be more desperate than this. So, no
advice on audio writing aids from me yet, but maybe others could
chime in in the comments?<br>

can understand you not wanting to write another book. I was
rereading Brother in Arms and Mirror Dance; seems they would have
been intense. And all your newer books are full sized. Have you
thought about a series of short stories or novellas to continue the

1 - Physically, perhaps; Sara's in her mid-30s when last seen by
her narrative. I don't think she'd want to. Being mistress of her
own estate, and far away from the scenes of her former pain, may be
enough for her. (But you may imagine whatever you like; published
canon offers no constraints.)<br>
<br>
2 - That's just how Cordelia walked onto the page. Not reason or
consequence or author agenda, merely initial condition. There are
plenty of sound scientists out there who also quietly hold
religious beliefs. (Guy Consolmagno, SJ, for a case in point -- you
can likely look him him up. MIT grad and Vatican astronomer.) It's
just that the noisy nutbars get all the press.<br>

This is not something that I would care to do.<br>
<br>
Though not for lack of having been asked. But it runs very counter
to the series' thematic structure (yes, it has one), and even more
counter to the intuitive way I write. It would not only be far more
work, and much less fun, than writing tales myself, it would block
my work on other, newer things, dragging me backward. Not a win
from my point of view.<br>

Thank you for the many many hours of entertainment you've provided
me over the last 20 years! I'm thouroughly enjoying the penric
stories now. I noticed that unlike the first 3 penric stories, the
4th one (which I'm still reading) happens just after the 3rd one.
Just curious, is there a plan to continue in that way, or did that
just happen for this story that wasn't finished at the end of book
3?</a></div>

Glad you are enjoying Pen & Des! So am I, thus far.<br>
<br>
Part of my, hm, not plan but hope for the Penric tales is to keep
the series structure as loose as possible. (Think how, say, the
original Sherlock Holmes stories work by accumulation while
stitching back and forth in the characters' lives, although they
have the card-up-the-sleeve of Watson's after-the-fact narration.)
I'd like to be able to jump around in Pen's timeline at will,
although my prior experience does show if one jumps too far forward
too fast it tends to block off sectors for development, so there
are some limits on that score. But not nearly as many as with more
rigid sequential-chronological structures. See <i>The Sharing
Knife</i> tetralogy for a worked example at the opposite end of the
spectrum.<br>
<br>
I do plan/hope to do more with Pen in Cedonia, but those ideas
aren't quite ripe yet.<br>

I'd like to get my self-pubbed books on Overdrive, yes, but my
current helpers are not set up for it, and I'm not up to doing it
by myself. So it's a hung project at present.<br>

The audio books are placed in Overdrive through and by Blackstone,
good on 'em. And, I believe, HarperCollins have placed my fantasies
from them.<br>

Baen is doing quite a nice trade paperback reprint series -- they
have the first five books out now. Starts here:<br>

No box sets planned, no.<br>

Also, NESFA Press has the first eight titles (which were original
paperbacks when they first came out) as nice hardcover reprints,
although that only goes up a till my first printings started coming
out as hardcovers.<br>

many do, but I also realize that all good things come to an end.
You are one of my favorite science-fiction authors because you
infuse such realism into your world and characters. In the real
world there aren't any definitive endings, and so I wonder, what is
to come?</a></div>

In the real world, indeed, there aren't any definitive endings.
That's one of its many differences from fiction.<br>
<br>
A present, I prefer to leave the series as it stands.<br>
<br>
It does make me wonder, though -- how many kinds of things do
different readers parse as an "ending"? (I mean, besides the writer
dropping dead, which in this world of publisher work-for-hire
extensions isn't even a sure bet.) Anyone want to say in the
comments?<br>
<br>
Observations of series dragged out beyond their natural ends can be
instructive, as well. I touched on this a little somewhere in the
recent manga and anime discussion on my blog.<br>

My mind has no wish to be plumbed at this time, nor even have
wiring run in, but off the top I can direct you to T. E. Lawrence,
Basil Liddell Hart, John Keegan, and Barbara Tuchman.<br>
<br>
Probably about a hundred more historians and memoirists (first-hand
accounts are way the best) whose names escape me without a major
spelunking. I read a lot of this stuff back in my teens, when WWII
was still saturating the zeitgeist, and my 20s. I was recently
reminded of <i>Bat Bomb</i> by Jack Couffer, my fave WWII memoir,
although it has no actual war in it. Unless you count burning down
the army air corps base.<br>
<br>
I don't think you realize how far down and murky the depths of my
mind are by now. A lot of my references are reduced to hand-waving
and things like, "that memoir by the youngest paratrooper general
(oh, Gavin), or "that appalling account of the Bataan death march"
(could be any of many), or "the one by the Pacific pilot (<i>Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep</i>, aha!) or "the one about the Flying Tigers",
or, "the one about the borked first landing in Italy", or... And so
on.<br>
<br>
You could just take it chronologically, and start with Thucydides,
I suppose. Or Herodotus. I can't say that either informed my mind
that much, but I guarantee many of the military geeks you wish to
study, studied them. Have not read Julius Caesar, but he still has
works in print, too.<br>

the treated disease would render him ineligible for joining the

They are considered Barrayaran Vor, and would be received as
visiting foreign VIPs (or dependents of same.)<br>
<br>
(Well, someone like Benin might see them as equivalent to live
grenades, but that's a different consideration.)<br>
<br>
Miles's genes being formally taken up by the Star Creche doesn't
make him socially or politically haut (nor would he consent to such
a conscription); they would not be used entire, after all, just

I can only answer as usual: not at this time.<br>
<br>
In general (though not always) my books start and grow with
interest in a character, not some sweep of events.<br>
<br>
<i>Ethan of Athos</i> is an exception of sorts, since it began with
the question, "What else can I do with this SFnal technology?" but
even it didn't begin to roll out until the main character presented
himself.<br>

lucky enough to be sent to work in the US for a couple of months
back in October 1996, just in time for Memory in hardback and
Cetaganda in paperback. You've mentioned before how your UK
publisher dropped you after Paladin Of Souls (idiots that they
were, in my opinion). I apologise if this has been asked and
answered before, but how did Cetaganda not get a UK
publication?</a></div>

chose to offer for it. I can't sell books to publishers who don't
want them. What they were thinking, I have no idea, and it is
likely too late to ask.<br>
<br>
Happily, I now have direct e-publication of all my works in the UK,
which has been holding steady and even slowly growing from its
inception in 2011, as more readers discover e-books.<br>
<br>
Note that when discussing my UK non-career, we are talking about
four different publishers over time. Two of the lines, Pan and
Earthlight, were discontinued while I was in them, rather like
having one's horse shot out from under one, so it wasn't just me
affected.<br>
<br>
To be fair, the first mistake was mine back in the late 80s, when
my (actually Baen's, at that point) then-foreign-rights agent took
the VK series from Headline to Pan after book #4 for the sake of a
higher advance. We should have stuck with Headline... maybe. It was
all downhill from there. Too late, live and learn, etc.<br>

"/questions/1144049-hey-i-was-wondering-if-there-are-any">Hey, I
was wondering if there are any future plans to release your Penric
novellas in the UK, either individually or together in a volume? I
really enjoyed the three Chalion novels and would love to read the
novellas - it's just that I can't get along with reading from a
screen: I'm old-fashioned and need a paper book! Thanks and
apologies if you have already answered this question here
somewhere.</a></div>

They are all out as e-books in the UK, of course. You could have
them in seconds by downloading, say, the free Kindle app onto the
very screen you are reading from now. Not sure what iTunes offers
in that direction.<br>
<br>
A paper volume would depend on a British paper-books publisher
making an offer for them, which seems very unlikely. Even British
publishers (may) have woken up enough to want e-rights with their
package, which I am not foolish enough to part with. The chances of
anyone in the UK wishing to do paper-only like Subterranean Press
seem remote.<br>
<br>
Note that even SubPress doesn't get books into US stores, apart
from a few specialty shops. Their business model doesn't attempt to
cope with the book returns system (which is a whole 'nother
essay.)<br>
<br>
(At present, my own eyes are doing better with reading off a screen
than from paper print, for whatever reason. The ability to enlarge
type is a boon. Holding the device comfortably in one's lap or
hands is another issue, which I'm presently managing with a
board/tray that is padded underneath for my laptop and a small
triangular foam cushion to prop my tablet.)<br>

just purchased & downloaded Penric's Fox for my Kindle. However,
Amazon showed this book as "Penric's Fox: Penric and Desdemona Book
3 [Kindle Edition]". I have already read & very much enjoyed the
first 3 Penric novellas so Amazon should have listed Penric's Fox
as Book 4, right? It did have the "See inside" and I could clearly
see it had the text of Penric's Fox. Thanks for the

Since "Penric's Fox" follows "Penric and the Shaman" in internal
chronology, and the series is still pretty short, I decided to give
it its proper tag and renumber the following novellas.<br>
<br>
See: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/15509939-penric-series-renumbering-puzzle">
https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog...</a> for the full
debate.<br>
<br>
Also, you seem to be one behind in your Penrics -- there are now 5
novellas total. In new (as of Aug. 2017) chronological order, they
are now:<br>
<br>
Penric's Demon<br>
Penric and the Shaman<br>
Penric's Fox<br>
Penric's Mission<br>
Mira'a Last Dance.<br>

Barrayar (as much as anyone had time for such trips)? Also, is

likely Elizabeth came to Barrayar than Aral went to Beta, although
some diplomatic journey is possible toward the later, quieter part
of his regency.<br>
<br>
They would have got along all right eventually, though both would
have been stiff at first, and a stiff Aral is a little hard for
anyone not Cordelia or maybe Simon or Alys to read.<br>
<br>
I haven't heard anything lately about the re-releases. You should
likely ask over at Baen; they have a Facebook page and a

"/questions/1151346-ethan-of-athos-is-one-of-my-favorites">"Ethan
of Athos" is one of my favorites and, perhaps, one of the most
socially significant stories you've written because it demonstrates
the power of encounters with the "hated other" to transform bigotry
into respect. It's lack of popularity grieves me. I have wondered
if a story about a planet made up of women who are equally
suspicious of men (but for non-religious reasons) might be better
received. Thoughts?</a></div>

latter had already been written (mostly in the 60s and 70s, by both
men and women) at the time I wrote <i>Ethan of Athos</i>, and in
fact <i>Ethan</i> was in part a riposte to those. The fact that
you'd never heard of them may answer your question?<br>
<br>
<i>Ethan</i> has done pretty well to survive 31 years still in
print/ebook and available, I think. Readers can still find it. As a
general rule, only new books get booted up onto bestseller lists,
but selling quietly for a long time can add up, too. Word-of-mouth
has been the lifeblood of my career.<br>

pacing them out like this and whispersyncing the ebook with the

the protagonists (may have mentioned that earlier). It's almost sad
if Penric gets shortened to Pen, though, so would you consider this
compromise: use Pen in spoken language, and Penric, in full, in
storytelling?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>After typing
out "Vorkosigan" approximately one million times, I was determined
that my next series protagonist should have as short a name as
possible.<br>
<br>
"Pen" vs. "Penric" is decided on the fly, according to who is
speaking, in what mode, whether I'm just establishing things or am
further along, sentence rhythm, and how much variation or
lack-of-repetition I need in a particular passage.<br>
<br>
(I actually made up the name "Penric", constructing it from a
syllable salad, and then discovered it is also a real name. Not a
common one, though.)<br>
<br>
Unlike Tolkien, who apparently adored naming things, naming is a
bit of a burden for me. It is necessary to defamiliarize names from
our-world, key them to their respective distinct languages and
cultures, and try not to inadvertently name people after obscure
airplane parts or bad words in foreign tongues. The rise of
internet searches makes checking the latter much more possible than
it used to be, but also more necessary.<br>

I can't say when. As a general rule, I have found it better for my
process (and sanity) not to discuss works in process or possibility
until the first draft is nearly bagged. I am not, I must remind
people, a fast writer, so there's no point hanging around underfoot
in the kitchen until after I call you for the meal.<br>

"/questions/1171469-on-a-re-listen-of-the-vorkosigan">On a
re-listen of the Vorkosigan audiobooks recently, I noticed a 1-line
reference to the tunnels under Vorbarr Sultana that were used to
such great effect in Captain Vorpatril's Alliance - which was
written about 20 years later. This got me to wondering: how much
research of your own work is (was) involved in preparing for a new
entry in a series that has been written over such a length of
time?</a></div>

Very often, something that was a throw-away line in an earlier work
gets exploited and expanded in a later work, giving a flattering

re-reading all three, plus gaining more understanding of spirit
animals from Penric, I am happy to say I was totally wrong. I did
not dig under the surface like I should have. Maybe I am older and
smarter now? Great book. And now I understand why you used the POV

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I'm glad you
revisited <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i>! Yes, that one seems
particularly prone to suffer from readers expecting it to be some
other book, and being peeved when it does not match their
expectations, instead of mine.<br>
<br>
I am about to start recommending readers approaching Chalion read
it first, to circumvent that expectations-effect. Although that
might just generate the same problems in reverse order. I'd need to
hear from a few more readers who'd read <i>tHH</i> first in order
to form a theory.<br>
<br>
I have heard from quite a few readers who, like you, read it again
later and had a wholly different and more satisfactory experience.
But persuading readers to read again a book they bounced off of in
the first place is a bit of a trick.<br>
<br>
Passive-aggressive bully-boy Ingrey was a very interesting
viewpoint character for me to write, but I can see how his prickly
surface (and interior) could be off-putting at first. And his
character-arc was not to become a saint, like Caz or Ista, but a
sacred king, quite a different job description. But, yeah, there
may be such a thing as a writer trying to be too subtle.<br>

to have some fun playing with a really powerful sorcerer character.
Once I decided to set him in the Chalion universe, a lot of the
parameters and limits came factory-default. Then the game became to
see what all I, and he, could do to explore them. We'd seen
sorcerers before in the 5GU, but never from their own points of
view.<br>
<br>
Of course, once characters are set up and initially launched, they
have a way of riding off down their own roads, the more so as they
have time and space to develop. This takes us both to unexpected
places, which is rather the point of such a journey.<br>
<br>
The ala carte novella structure of Penric's tales is meant to give
me the maximum choice of routes.<br>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The largest
pay-through to the author are the indie-published e-books.
Kindle/Nook/iTunes give the author 65% - 70% of what the customer
actually pays. Another important factor is that these are
<i>vendors</i> not publishers, on which more below.<br>
<br>
E-books published through a publisher are next, although losing
between half and three-fourths of the proceeds along the way
depending on one's contractual royalty rate. (In return for
services rendered, variously valuable or essential.)<br>
<br>
Next would be publisher hardcovers, which usually come out at about
10% - 15% of the cover price to the author.<br>
<br>
Next would be mass-market paperbacks, normally between 6% to 10% of
the cover price to the author, although I've heard some abusive
publishers (including Romance and academic) may chew it down as low
as 2%.<br>
<br>
The other two elements that have to be factored in to calculate
actual income-to-the-writer are, What is the cover price? and How
many copies can be sold?<br>
<br>
Another factor is authorial control. Publishers of any sort require
contracts and rights licensing which, depending on the terms, can
remove the author's control of the book for anything from some set
number of years (OK) to term-of-copyright (or as I call it, unto
the heat-death of the universe.) This latter is best avoided,
although again, a particular author with a particular title and
particular other terms may decide it's worthwhile to them. In the
era of paper-books-only, one could commonly get these rights back
for one's out-of-print titles for the asking, but now that e-books
are forever and most publishers are immortal corporations, this is
a lot harder to do.<br>
<br>
The fact that the vendors listed in the first paragraph are not
publishers is huge for authorial control. They don't own/license
any exclusive rights in one's book. The author puts works up or
takes them down at the author's will (and a month's notice), and
sets their own prices. There are a few pitfalls in the process, as
in any process, but on the whole, including the all-important
distribution, indie e-books win over any other form of publication
in terms of potential benefit to the actual writer. (Or, to be
fair, I should say "actual established writer." But that's a whole
'nother essay.)<br>
<br>
To answer the question you actually asked, above, any of my three
vendors are effectively equal in terms of what I get, so whatever
platform is most convenient to you is fine.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Nope, such a
thing is not for me. In the old days, impending
running-out-of-money was enough to keep me focused, if sometimes
frantic. Nowadays the pressures are internal, mainly a work
demanding its own completion.<br>
<br>
I get stuck regularly, and shoving through is not usually a good
idea. It just results in me trying to write Wrong Things, which my
backbrain perfectly well knows are wrong or the vision-spigot would
not have shut down so firmly.<br>
<br>
Although "keeping at it" is required, the process is oblique.
Sometimes it means backing off for a bit till the well refills,
especially if I have just written out the last spate and have to
stop and take stock. Other times it means I need to do some more
research of some sort, import the key idea or notion that unlocks
the present puzzle. Talking out the plot snag with certain friends
also sometimes helps, if not directly, stirring things up,
brainstorming, what Pat Wrede calls "plot noodling".<br>
<br>
I am a sort of mini-burst writer, with the bursts being, generally,
one scene long. The vision of the scene comes up in my head -- one
scene being all it can hold at a time -- and I marshal it up for
the march by making a quick draft in penciled notes to nail the
spine and structure and good bits, choreograph the dialogue, and so
on. If I am interrupted after this point, I won't lose it. I
sometimes wait a few hours or a day to let anything else slot in or
shift. Take the notes to the computer and get it down, lather,
rinse, repeat. I generally need to know what just came before the
scene under construction (which is easy because I've already
written it) and what comes after, so it will be aimed in the right
direction and come out in the right place for the transition to the
Next Bit.<br>

vs question: recently listened to Dunesteef's podcast of Scare
Tactics, by Aeryn Rudel. Our world, woman has a demon entrapped in
a giant Raggedy Ann doll, communicates with it while helping rid
places of fake (or in one case real) spirits. Kept thinking of
Penric and Des the whole time. I wonder if the author is also a
Penric fan? Amusing listen, anyway.</a></div>

more precisely, that the self-e-publishing part has grown
frighteningly fast. Writing still takes (me) as much time as
ever.<br>
<br>
I did finally make the shift, a few years back, to not printing out
chapters as I went, instead working paperless just with e-files.
(My paper consumption has dropped from cartons to next to nothing.)
I find I do a lot more micro-editing this way, although I'm not
sure that makes a discernible difference on the readers' end. But
the editing-as-I-go, at the sentence level and scene by scene, has
also grown in importance, as there is less time at the end to
second-guess everything.<br>

there! I wish I could rant on about how much I love your work, but
space is limited, so you'll have to trust me on that. I find myself
enjoying your romances more than those in most fiction I
read--definitely in part for the high-quality witty banter, but
also because you write characters who really seem to complement
each other. Is this based on your experience of romance? Some
idealized version of love? Both?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Idealized, I
suppose. Most F&amp;SF readers demand their main characters be
smart, and I have a low tolerance for the "stupid misunderstanding"
romance plot as a way to keep the principals apart for whatever the
length of the story. (Certain comedies excepted.*) There are lots
more interesting problems that can be evoked to keep people apart
as needed.<br>
<br>
Those who spurn romance stories because the outcome seems set are
mistaking what the plots are about, I think. The question a romance
plot must pose, and answer (showing one's work!) is not "Do these
two people get together?" but rather "Can I trust you?" Which is
most certainly not a trivial problem, in art or in life.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
* I am now thinking of Georgette Heyer's <i>Friday's Child</i>,
where nearly all the main characters are young idiots, and the
reader's hilarity and suspense comes from watching the ensuing
train-wreck. But while the characters are over-the-top feckless,
the book itself is very smart.<br></span></div>

That will be up to some print publishing company to decide. They
know where to find my agent... There are enough for two reasonable
3-novella collections, now, in proper order. But note that

was something of an early influence for you, the thought drifted
across my mind that Ivan is a many generations distant descendent
of Freddy from Cottilion (he is my favorite character amongst
Heyer's books). Both tend to be overshadowed by brighter stars,
both have down to earth common sense. Was Freddie also a favorite
of yours?</a></div>

Have you heard of this? It just debuted on Facebook and online,
there's an app too. Romance based, but I believe your books are
romance based in addition to science fiction. Not sure what you
have to do to be an author on the site. Might be worth checking
out. https://bookandmainbites.com</a></div>

Heh. I have no idea how Amazon's algorithms work. Good for me,
though, because my works turn up on lots of pages through those
connections, which may well be the only way some readers learn of
them.<br>
<br>
Walter Jon Williams is good, though; I like Steve Brust but no idea
what <i>Ballista</i> is; I've only read half of one Modesitt --
inventive but PoV character seemed to lack interiority. The rest I
do not know, because I have been buried so deep in the avalanche of
popular culture I may never be found alive.<br>
<br>
<i>Does</i> anyone know how Amazon comes up with these? I would
assume some mechanized statistical buying survey...<br>

No, Alys was not a Vorrutyer. Ivan is related to that line through
his dad.<br>
<br>
Ivan mentions aunts somewhere -- I posit Alys has some sisters,
number unknown but plural, less possibly some brothers, living
elsewhere, not in the capital scene. Probably with families, hence
the sort of cousins one meets maybe half-a-dozen times in one's
childhood and barely knows. Yes, I would suspect the sisters are
also well-bred and tough-minded.<br>

Ah, thanks for the link. Reader response is always fascinating in
its infinite variety. "A book is like a mirror" as someone said.
(The second half of that quote is more rude, and does not apply
here, although it does demonstrate that the sometimes-strained
relationship between writers and reviewers has not changed in
centuries.)<br>
<br>
I had a great trip to Barcelona back in 2008, which I remember
fondly. It always boggles me a bit when my work turns up in
academic courses. I hope your students are having good luck and a
good time with their reads!<br>

No relation whatsoever. The name actually started out as Redwell,
in the first draft, but I thought it sounded too much like
Redwall.<br>

read e-books on an iPad and mostly get them from iBooks. The
indications of genre in 'Library' view are all over the place:
"Penric's Demon" is labeled 'Historical', "Penric's Mission" and
"Paladin of Souls" 'Epic', "The Curse of Chalion" 'Paranormal'. Of
course many others are better labeled. I suppose that you are not
the decider, but do you have any influence? And who does
decide?</a></div>

I have neither influence, nor control, nor in most cases even
knowledge. I have no idea who is responsible for the genre or
subgenre labeling in catalogs, but if it is individual library
systems or even individual vendors, it could be all over the map.
I'd call them all "Fantasy", myself.<br>

"The Prisoner of Limnos" several times, I was startled when a
friend from the U.P. mentioned yesterday a cruel local practice
among youth there of tossing food to seagulls, which they caught on
the fly, and then tossing an Alka Seltzer tablet, which MADE THE
GULL EXPLODE. (I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this story--it
may be so or it may be rural myth.) Had you heard of

No, that decision was set at the time I wrote "The Mountains of
Mourning" in the late 80s/early 90s, though of course Miles didn't
know it yet. The story was occasioned by a friendly debate between
me and Jim Baen, discussing whether to have the banner over the
titles read "A Miles Naismith Adventure" or "A Miles Vorkosigan
Adventure". Jim was hoping for "Naismith", and lots of milSF tales.
The novella showed him why it had to be "Vorkosigan".<br>
<br>
I knew then that Miles would have to go back home someday, though I
did not yet envision when or how. By the time I finished <i>Mirror
Dance</i>, I knew.<br>

No, I cannot briefly outline my thoughts that went into its
world-building, not least because it was 18 years ago. And would be
as long as the novel itself. But you might be able to find some
things in the interviews I did around that time period, early
2000s.<br>

It started by looking at 15th C. Spanish history, and wondering why
no one was stealing its lurid events the way they mine the Wars of
the Roses. But it didn't end there. Lots of long-brewing thoughts
about how religion is treated in fantasy got folded in
underneath.<br>

Nope. "Vor" is an aristocratic prefix I made up for the sound of
it, back in the day, in echo of such things as the German "von",
French "de", Dutch "van der", and others. I was pleased to learn
later that it was also the Russian word for "thief", which fit
right in.<br>

Yes, Bosha is very beguiling. (My plaint on him, while I was
writing what became "The Prisoner of Limnos", was "Surakos Bosha is
a damned scene-stealer!") He has this crowded and lurid backstory
which might be interesting to explore in more detail, even though,
broadly, we know how it comes out. How he came to the Xarre
household and earned his place of trust might not be such a Tale
Already Told as I think.<br>
<br>
My knowledge of albinism is necessarily constructed from research
(including a few historical and folk-tale references; it's a trope
in more than one culture.) Nobody in my personal small circle of
acquaintance to lend those extra telling details that don't make it
into written sources, alas. In my defense, I did give him some eye
issues with the photosensitivity...<br>
<br>
Any potential Bosha front-story, ongoing, runs into an even greater
wall of complexity than his backstory. I have a lot of ideas about
my characters' lives, but extracting suitable novella-length tales
out of them is a trickier proposition. And, of course, anything and
everything written always spawns yet more potential threads. (While
cutting off others.)<br>

facile answer is I Made It Up; the long one, which would be as long
as my autobiography, that it evolved out of a lifetime of learning
about, contemplating, and reading about real-world religions. The
smattering of writing I've read from and about real mystics across
a variety of faiths gave me a sense that they were all indeed
honing in on some same thing, whether the godhead or the 60-cycle
hum of their own biology being unclear. (Presuming the two are not
the same.) Also from reading about the social functions historical
societies carried out, and still carry out, with and through
real-world religions -- teaching, medical aid, charity, orphanages,
occasions for art, all sorts of community self-organized self-help.
I wanted my fantasy-world religion to partake of both these serious
endeavors. (Politics, like the poor, may always be with us.)<br>
<br>
It also gave me a chance to argue with dualism, which is, in my
view, a mistaken construction of the world that has done much harm
through history. I wanted to make my gods both profound and
evolutionary, based on a frame of the concept of emergent
properties, which is about as far from the rigid simplicity of
dualism as anything I've yet encountered.<br>
<br>
And, of course, wanting to write my fantasy-world religion this way
was indeed a reaction the the facile D&amp;D-style constructions of
religion.<br>

The book read to Umegat in the very last of <i>The Curse of
Chalion</i> and of course the pilgrimage party in the opening
chapter of <i>Paladin of Souls</i> were as-it-were shout-outs to
<i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, especially the Chalionese version of
the Wife of Bath. After that, the tale was on its own.<br>

read one of your interviews on LJ (Karen Miller, 2007). In it you
mentioned a 6 week study tour of Africa. What was that like? Have
you written more about that trip somewhere? Do you still have any
of those picture slides you took? You also mentioned hitchhiking in
Europe! What countries? I'd love to hear more if you ever feel like
talking about these adventures. ^^ -Kalli</a></div>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The Africa trip
was in 1971, and the Europe one in 1965, so both over 50 years ago.
While I still remember more about them than any of my high school
classes, I don't think I have the endurance to type them out just
now.<br>
<br>
I do still have all the slides. No slide projector or other method
of displaying them, however. (Note to all the techie readers about
to jump in with advice, Yes, I know they could be converted to
digital. No, I'm not on for that project just now either,
thanks.)<br>
<br>
The hitch-hiking was with my 21-year-old brother (I was 15.) 1965
was likely just on the cusp before such a thing came to be
considered too dangerous. Youth hostels and his valiant attempt to
tour Europe on $5 a day. We did England, Scotland, and a bit of
Wales. Switzerland and north Italy were in there somewhere, and
passenger trains, a novelty to my Midwestern experience. (My
brother was a big train and model railroad buff. To this day I
still find public mass transportation alien and daunting.) Three
weeks of this, switched to trains in France, where it wasn't so
easy to thumb it, then he dumped me with my parents in Paris, once
we'd finally found their hotel, and he went north to Scandinavia
and we went south by car to Germany and Italy.<br>
<br>
This was back in the days when a trip overseas was considered a
once-in-a-lifetime experience, not a weekend jaunt. I was, of
course, totally ignorant of the histories much of what I was
seeing, and no internet to fill in, hah, but less so by the end.
1965 trip is also memorable for being where I first found <i>The
Fellowship of the Ring</i>, on a used-book rack in Rome. I would
say, "Left by some hippie," but hippies weren't invented yet.<br>

Bujold, here's a (probably) odd one. In the Bulgarian version of
"Mirror Dance", ch. 16, Lady Vorpatril tells Ivan to "[be] careful
with the young Vorsossion", who is "a sister of Violet Vorsossion".
That has stood out to me on every re-read of the series, since we
later hear of the *Vorsoissons*. Is this an issue with the
translation, or are the two ladies really members of the
"Vorsossion" family?</a></div>

I'd not seen this bit.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm now sold on buying a general-purpose tablet
computer and downloading ALL the reader apps, usually free, to it.
(Mine is brilliant for manga, it turns out.) My helpers, besides
being overrun with the work on their plates now, say that Kobo is a
minor sales venue. If Kobo gets stronger, that opinion might
change.<br>

My books have been translated into over 20 languages, although<br>
not all titles in all languages. Note that this is over the course
of my whole career, so many editions will have aged out of license
and into oblivion.<br>
<br>
First place to look, I suppose, is at the publisher websites of the
target-language countries. AST (in Cyrillic ACT) has been my
Russian publisher. Next would be the country Amazon site, if they
have one. I know Japan, France, and Germany Amazons sometimes have
my books. After that (or through that) used-book vendors in the
language of interest.<br>
<br>
Offhand, from memory before my morning tea, my books have been
translated to:<br>
<br>
Spanish<br>
French<br>
German<br>
Italian<br>
Hungarian<br>
Finnish<br>
Estonian<br>
Croatian<br>
Bulgarian<br>
Greek<br>
Czech<br>
Russian<br>
Japanese<br>
Chinese<br>
Hebrew<br>
Frisian<br>
Dutch<br>
Korean<br>
Lithuanian<br>
Polish<br>
<br>
Hm, I feel I'm missing something... I may have been counting
Chinese traditional and simplified as two. We had a recent offer in
Thai, but nothing has come of it yet.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to contemplate which countries or regions
apparently read SF, and which don't. I know in some of the smaller
countries, like Croatia, Finland, and the Netherlands, most people
who do read the genres do so in English, for breadth of access.<br>

I likely wouldn't begin writing the Vorkosigan saga today, so.<br>
<br>
Although Barrayar, as such, is still a metaphor for the 20th
Century, so that still stands, even as the 20th C. is fading as
fast as people can get away.<br>

The six extant Penric & Desdemona tales are ready for two 3-novella
omnibus paper volumes, if some print publisher wants to step up to
the plate; there is a contractual wait for the stories to age out
of Subterranean Press's term of exclusive license, however, which
will be a while yet given that the last two haven't even been
printed the first time. (Still to go are "Mira's Last Dance" and
"The Prisoner of Limnos". Given that it takes the average big
publisher a year to get a book to print press, it does seem like
some of the wait could double up with normal lead time.)<br>
<br>
They know where my agent lives, so.<br>
<br>
Note that we want a publisher capable of getting books into
brick-and-mortar bookstores, otherwise there's no point.<br>
<br>
(My experiment with print-on-demand with <i>The Spirit Ring</i> was
lackluster in results, so I'm in no hurry to repeat it.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, you might try interlibrary loan.<br>

Ms. Bujold - not a question so much as a comment. I empathize with
reader Alict, who asked about plans to release the Penric series in
print. The only reason I have an e-reader - purchased after much
soul-searching, pulling of hair, and gnashing of teeth - is because
I couldn't buy the novellas as, well, what I still think of as
"real books." That being said--Penric made it worthwhile.
Thanks?</a></div>

You're welcome?<br>
<br>
I think you will find e-readers a useful addition to print works. I
have certainly been enjoying my devices. My Kindle Paperwhite was
good, and got me into the game, but I do have to say my Android
tablet beats it for readability and range. (Manga is brilliant on
it.) The Paperwhite remains more portable, however. Depends one's
needs.<br>
<br>
(The Subterranean Press limited paper edition of "Penric's Demon"
is now selling in the secondhand market for quite insane prices,
making your device look even more of a bargain, for a while.)<br>

stopped hoping for another "Miles" book because I'm afraid you'd
kill him. But in the meantime, I've fallen in love with Pen and Des
- dare I hope for more? Also - can you cast Pen for my mind's eye?
I can't find an actor who is blonde, pretty and looks younger than
his years. Orlando Bloom as Legolas was VERY pretty, but don't
think he could look young enough now. I guess they could go blonde
wig again, but ...</a></div>

Alas, I don't follow actors enough to have a suggestion for Pen. I
went off to look at an internet picture array when Ron Miller, the
artist, and I were kicking around cover ideas, but he went with
landscape (or seascape) instead, to my relief. None of the shots I
saw then were totally satisfactory. So for the casting game y'all
are on your own. I note hair color is changeable; facial structure
would be the key.<br>
<br>
Nothing new is in progress at the moment -- it's been a sluggish
winter. All sitting around watching Great Courses and anime, and
not going outdoors. New Pen is not impossible, especially given his
flexible story-length options, but the next idea spark has not yet
reported for duty.<br>

Lois - you’ve referenced your love of manga a couple times. What
are some of your favorite titles? I like it, but don’t often find
one I can really sink into, as with a good novel — the last being
the scanlation of Yokohama Shopping Trip / Quiet Country Cafe
(which I’d highly recommend). Thanks.</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Manga and anime
rather run together for me, since my interest usually starts with
the anime and then, if it really catches my interest, I track back
to the manga to compare or continue (since the anime versions often
stop short.) Some dual faves include <i>Mushi-shi, Pandora Hearts,
Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, and its parallel work
<i>xxxHolic</i>. <i>Bleach</i> in parts, like the curate's egg.
<i>Saiunkoku</i>, if I'm remembering the spelling, was very good
but broke off unfinished. The anime of it is now hard to find.
<i>Paprika</i> remains my favorite feature film. There are lots of
others that I've found interesting, but not necessarily re-watch
gripping.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for that novel-like feel, I'd recommend
<i>Pandora Hearts</i>, if you haven't read it already. Excellent
art, plus it has the virtue of actually being a fully (if weirdly)
finished work.<br>
<br>
Ease-of-access is the main driver of my current explorations --
Netflix, Crunchyroll (anime plus e-manga), and my public library
have been my main sources to date. I don't usually buy volumes
unless I've sampled them already and can't get them any other way,
though the ease of downloading (and storing, and reading) e-manga
from Amazon is leading to more actual trial purchases.
Rightstuf.com has proved another source for the obscure,
sometimes.<br>

Glad you've enjoyed the book!<br>
<br>
I think it was informed mainly by observation of the world around
me, but in general I am a believer in gradients of human behavior,
not tidy boxes. Not that tidy boxes aren't very popular, among
those who wish the world to be simpler than it is...<br>
<br>
The other observation, of course, is that children create, and
certainly mold, parents, at all sorts of levels and in all sorts of
feedback loops, from the most basic biological survival up through
deep patterns of culture. And these, too, all exist on
gradients.<br>

I've been across a few passes by car, in the Rockies and the Alps.
And I've ridden horseback. Not at the same time, but it isn't hard
to meld the two experiences together. (And the Cascades and in New
Zealand, come to think, though the latter were later. Travel is
good for a writer/future writer...)<br>

my brain seems to be a one-way bridge. Heavy input blocks output,
and eats time for rumination, or even for long-term memory
formation. Since modern media now provides an effectively infinite
river of input, and I have neither infinite time nor infinite
brain-space, I do have to go on a sort of self-imposed input diet
while actively creating. Or put another way, I start to create when
what's going on inside my head manages to be more interesting to me
than all that's coming in from outside.<br>

Naturally, this is growing harder, as modern media gets better and
better at competing for people's attention, and there is easier

a very strong spiritual affinity with the Five Gods theology to the

Five gods, I hope not. I have less than zero desire to follow in
the footsteps of L. Ron Hubbard...<br>
<br>
That said, there seems to be an interesting bifurcation in reviews
of the Five Gods stories, between readers who are alive to the
spiritual issues and take seriously how and why they drive the
characters, and another reader-stream who seem to be completely
tone-deaf to such issues, and thus find the courses of actions
baffling, pointless, trivial, or not matching their expectations of
how a story should go and why.<br>

visit the Am. Society of Nondestructive Testing offices last week
and saw the plaque dedicating their conference room to your father.
'McMaster' is an uncommon enough name that it caught my eye, and
closer investigation revealed the quote from you. I had to explain
my 'fangirl' squeal to my colleagues and the staff there. He sounds
like an amazing person. Would you like pictures of the three

Fun! I'm going to assume you wanted to share this with the world,
and not just me... The questions do seem to be made anonymous, so
this should be OK even if you didn't.<br>
<br>
Just a general note, the Goodreads messaging system is best for
private emails. (I grant it's not easy to make work. Tips welcome
in the comments section below.) But anything one doesn't actually
want publicly posted and archived for all time in the Q&amp;A
column should go there.<br>

the tiles in front of the Nasrid sultan's throne were inscribed

Porifors is a sort of generic melange of an assortment of minor
Spanish military castles, not including the Alhambra. (Its region
was never that rich!) Internal design as per the needs of my
plot.<br>
<br>
(The Zange was somewhat inspired by the Alcazar of Segovia,
however. Also internally redesigned per plot. Another fun fact:
"Cazaril" is a partial anagram of the word alcazar.)<br>

I suspect the impact of engineers upon the world is rather greater
than that of writers, but one must reflect who it is gets to write
the accounts... :-) Engineers are quieter, their successes found in
all the disasters that don't happen, and thus are never taken note
of.<br>
<br>
I do wish my dad could have lived to see some of my later successes
-- he died a month after my first book was published, at which time
it was by no means clear if this writing stuff was going to work
out for me.<br>

I actually made up the prefix "Vor" for the sound of it, to evoke
such aristocratic markers as the German "von", the French "de", and
so on. I was however very pleased to learn later about the Russian
word, as it seemed to fit very well for a caste that started as
some sort of mounted thugs, or counter-thugs (because that sort of
thing is contagious), and looking at the histories of warlords and
feudalism in our world.<br>

"/questions/1314699-i-m-rereading-a-civil-campaign-for-the">I’m
rereading A Civil Campaign for the millionth time and am wondering
about the Vorrutyer family. Where do Byerly, Richars and Dono’ s
parents fall in birth order to Ges and his ill-fated sister (was
she ever named in the series)? Did Ges have any children? Thinking
of Richars as Ges’ nephew (or son?) certainly adds some potency to
the references to his behavior by By and Dono from their younger
years. Thank you!</a></div>

actually that hard. 5 kids altogether of the Count VR in that
generation.<br>
<br>
First son and heir was Pierre's and Donna's father. Second son was
Ges, who had no legitimate or known offspring. Third child was
Aral's ill-fated first wife, who also died without offspring.
Fourth-child-third-son was Richars's father,
Fifth-child-fourth-and-youngest son was By's father.<br>
<br>
By has one sister, Richars has at least two sons and possibly one
or more daughters; any sisters for Richars unknown but not
impossible. Dono and Olivia will have several children, and By's
potential reproduction is unknown. Any miscarriages or children
dying very young are not known/invented, though the former is
probable and the latter possible especially in the earlier
generations, adding gaps to spacing between siblings.<br>

I'm glad you enjoyed the tetralogy! <i>The Sharing Knife</i> tends
to get less love than my other series, and I have several
hypotheses but no certainty as to why, except that those who do
like it, like it a lot. Bless them. The target audience (if there
were such a thing, and not just me throwing stories into the air to
land where they will) seems to have a thinner overlap with my other
audiences, I guess.<br>
<br>
All I can say is what I say about similar inquiries for all of my
books: I have nothing planned at this time.<br>

Lois, How do you know when a novel is “finished?” Do you find
yourself tweaking things for weeks after you first think you are
done with a story, or are you more of a “once and done” kind of
author? When I paint, once I’ve signed my work, I never touch it
with a brush again. I was wondering if writing was the
same.</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I pretty much
know by gut feel when the events of a novel have come to the right
conclusion on the scene-by-scene level -- although for
<i>Cryoburn</i> I added the codicil/drabbles after some comments
from test readers, to keep folks from galloping off in all
directions with sequel speculation. There follows a revision pass,
when I have collected and collated comments from test readers and
editors, on either the finished first draft or chapter by chapter,
depending, and respond to them as seems right. On the sentence and
word level, I tweak till the thing leaves my hands for publication,
and on the typo and polishing level, for decades after, as
opportunity permits.<br>
<br>
So, not much like painting, no.<br>

your own, though I could note that I have not inflicted the necktie
upon Barrayaran men.<br>

What Vor ladies wear will depend upon era, age, income, and venue
or function, so there's quite a lot of free play, there.<br>
<br>
I could add, the Russian fans were doing quite a lot of
Vorkosiverse costuming at one time -- there might be something
online for inspiration, or at such fan art refuges as Deviant Art.

Alas, no. My high school French was half a century ago, and has
gone down the same drain of time as my high school body. I can
recognize the others on a page, but cannot read them. (I can

as I recently saw a youtube series about "The Truth about Space
War" - the channel's name is Because Science - I came to realize I
think I've read that somewhere in the books. In Mirror Dance I
remember Mark recalling "The weapons were supposed to cook everyone
neatly, like eggs in their shells". Considering he's from a
universe in the future how scientifically aimed was that
statement?</a></div>

About as scientific as trying to boil a egg in its shell in a
microwave, I expect. I mean, we don't need future-science for
this.<br>
<br>
Or, for more immediately pertinent parallels, I suppose the autopsy
reports from submarine disasters would give some useful insights.
All the space disaster autopsies we possess so far are from
ground-based or atmospheric incidents.<br>
<br>
Biology and medicine. They are real sciences, people...<br>

(My closest speculative examination of the subject is probably the
short story "Aftermaths", found at the end of <i>Shards of

Yes, I presume. I'd written the opening of what you see back in
late 2011, early 2012, but it stalled out and other projects took
over. It was never intended to be novel length, though I'd thought
it was going to be a longer novella than it finally proved. Rather
like that description of the length of someone's legs: "long enough
to reach the ground." In this case, long enough to reach the
end.<br>

of retirement, I am choosing my own adventure, which is a lot
slower than most people think of as adventure. To the greatest
degree possible, it consists of avoiding the things about an
author's career that I found most wearing -- book tours, for
instance, or speaking or teaching engagements, or most cons, or in
general anything that involves getting on an airplane. Or
deadlines. Or contracts for anything that is not all the way
finished at least in first draft. (Some parts are not sluffable
ever -- keeping business and tax records, ferex.)<br>
<br>
It also consists of reading or watching whatever the heck I want,
and not ditto what I don't want. Less self-improvement -- I figure
it's all downhill from here anyway -- and more brain candy. Because
when someone my age or older says, "Life is short," they kinda mean
it. Personally, I blame my mitochondria -- see <a target="_blank"

(Granted, the recent anime binge has more to do with new
accessibility and the dratted epiretinal membrane/macular pucker
issues.)<br>
<br>
The indie self-publishing experiment, so far quite successful,
suits this plan well. Shortest possible route from story in my
brain --&gt; text --&gt; most succinct possible technical
transmission --&gt; text --&gt; story in reader's brain.<br>

Glad you enjoyed it!<br>
<br>
For the record, "Weatherman" was an out-take from <i>The Vor
Game</i>, the novel was not a continuation or expansion of the
novella. At the time, the <i>Analog</i> sale was a chance to turn
little more cash on the work, very much needed.<br>
<br>
But no, I have no plans for a continuation.<br>
<br>
Really, the story should be complete in itself; I'd be very
interested in reader response from someone for whom it is their
first Bujold, or at least their first Vorkosigan. I think it should
stand alone just fine, but I admit I haven't had a chance to test
that. "But they'll get a different read!" is not a useful
complaint, as everyone always gets a different read.<br>

Yes.<br>

You do not provide links or descriptions how to find either of the
things you reference. Try again?<br>
<br>
If, at a wild guess, you are trying to compare "The Flowers of
Vashnoi" and <i>Proto Zoa</i>, they could not be more different.
The first is my most recent Vorkosigan series novella, and the
second is a collection of my very earliest short stories from the
1980s.<br>
<br>
I don't see the covers as anything alike, although if one were
comparing them on a small black-and-white screen, maybe one might
make that mistake?<br>

Thanks for giving <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> a second chance! A
startling number of readers have reported the same first
read/second read effect you describe. I'm still trying to figure
out why.<br>
<br>
My current theory is that series readers were nonplussed by finding
it was not a continuation of the first two books, and spent their
first read mad at it for their thwarted expectations. Once they
calmed down and were willing to take it was it was, their reads
improved.<br>
<br>
Or it might be that they really did grow older and smarter, who
knows? Readers who shared this experience are welcome to chime in
below and share it some more.<br>

No, no plays or scripts from me. It's a different medium from
novels and short stories, etc., so I'd have to retrain, which I am
presently too lazy to do. More cogently, to achieve any kind of
performance and reach an audience, it requires working together
with people in groups.<br>
<br>
A mainstream novel I read once had the memorable line, discussing
the pleasures of life, "It takes two to make love, but eating you
can do alone." I would add writing fiction to that list.<br>

Oh, yes, in any large enough group there is a sprinkling of
anything. Some readers quite dislike Miles, too, or Barrayar in
general. (Why they keep reading the books in that case puzzles me,
but, oh well, readers.) Although I must say your friend sounds as
though she likes Cordelia quite well enough for going on with.<br>
<br>
One thing some people seem to miss is that in her first two books,
we see Cordelia from the inside, all her doubts on display, and in
all but the last of the later books, we see her from the outside,
in brief fragments. That changed angle of view, and the information
it does/does not take in, makes a huge difference in perception. (I
play with this a bit in GJ&amp;RQ.) Information bias and viewpoint
control are a valuable tools in the writer's toolkit, especially
for characterization but also for plot and worldbuilding.<br>

Running out of money used to work quite well...<br>
<br>
In recent years (and from the beginning as well), the work itself
demands its own completion. Not, alas, on anything resembling a
regular schedule. I've described half a novel as like half a
bridge, useless until complete from shore to shore.<br>
<br>
There is usually also some significant emotional reward for getting
the work out there and read, and getting reader feedback. It is,
after all, Attention, with luck more positive than negative.<br>

Not per se, but it's an interesting conundrum. Approximately ten
million tales from the points of view of teens, almost none from
their parents (the Enemy, usually, in coming-of-age tales, as is
older authority generally.) Mothers, parents, and domesticity are
perceived by many readers to be the antithesis of exciting
stories.<br>

You should have something on Goodreads called your "Author
Dashboard", most likely accessible from your Profile page, or from
that drop-down menu from the circle on the far upper right. Start
there and explore its tips. It has a link called "Author Tutorial"
right on it.<br>
<br>
I no longer remember how I first found/founded my own Author
Dashboard, so perhaps a poster with a better memory could chime in
below with more directing advce?<br>

I can, but the route there is long and roundabout, and involves
more Cedonian politics and time than I want to deal with right now.
(Actually many potential routes, which doesn't make it easier.)
Maybe someday. No promises.<br>
<br>
And then there's Bosha's entire angsty backstory, which could be a
novel in its own right, but a weird one. Also with a problem or six
about a satisfactory ending. But yes, Surakos Bosha is certainly
one of those characters who unexpectedly leap off the page.<br>

Ekaterin is already mature when the story opens; no YA heroine,
she. So she has much less "character development" to do at age 35
than Miles had at 20. The experience will inform and enlarge her
abilities as Lady Vorkosigan, going forward. Because Countess is a
job description as well as a title.<br>

I had not seen this, but the practices it discusses are by no means
unusual, especially across history. (And prehistory, though that's
harder to suss out.) Look up the infanticide practices of the
Romans and Greeks, if you want something closer to home. I don't
know if anyone has done work on the practices of the Teutonic
tribes, but I'd expect something similar, or in any culture that is
periodically or routinely thrust to the edge of survival.<br>
<br>
Selective infanticide is the historical norm. <i>Saving</i> such
children is new, and largely a consequence of advances in
technology and the economy. (As a rule of thumb, people tend to
embrace the moralities they can afford.)<br>

"/questions/1364537-hallowed-hunt-is-rapidly-becoming-one-of">"Hallowed
Hunt" is rapidly becoming one of my favorite books; I've read, and
reread it about three times in the last six weeks. You are so deft
in the way you unfold a story about character from "left field"
becoming the tool for restoring order to a system that became
unbalanced through a misguided use of power. Since a question is
required, did "Hallowed Hunt" draw some inspiration from
shamanistic practices?</a></div>

Glad you are enjoying the book! I do think surly Ingrey grows on
one, if given a chance.<br>
<br>
Really, only the name and a loose connection with animal practices
and sacrifices is brought over from our-world sources. Almost
everything else about 5-gods-world shamanism is made up for the
purposes of, and to be consistent with, the world-building of the
story.<br>

No, although I certainly thought about it.<br>
<br>
Amusingly, quite a few readers over the years, some admittedly
speaking other languages, have not recognized "Lois" as a feminine
name, so I got some of that marketing gender confusion for free
anyway.<br>
<br>
Although whenever I am put to signing a large stack of books, I
often regret not going with "Lois McMaster", which would have cut
the time folks had to spend in signing lines by a third.<br>

bests, Lois.</span></div>

No working link, there, but my quotes bob around all over the
internet, so I'm not surprised. Out of context, mostly, and
attributed to me even when it was a fictional character in a
fictional situation speaking. The game of Twitter Telephone being
what it is, that may backfire weirdly someday, but so far it seems
OK.<br>

"/questions/1374955-having-now-read-all-your-novels-i-m-more">Having
now read all your novels, I’m more convinced than ever you’d
appreciate Miyazaki’s long Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind
manga. (Its story overlaps with only the beginning of the movie.)
He spent 11 years on it, probably his best work. Vivid characters,
deeply moving, purposeful world building, nothing cliché or even
particularly familiar. If you’re exploring some manga, why
not?</a></div>

glad it did. It's an "African-American historical fiction" novel on
slavery and plantation drama in 1852. I've googled "How to get book

I'd think they'd want his <i>brains</i>, but, nature, nurture, not
to mention nutrition. Replicating Miles would be a lot harder than
just copying his DNA. I don't think the Cetagandans have any
particular motivation to gratuitously extend his life.<br>
<br>
As far as medical aid goes, I'd think Miles would be a lot more
comfortable going to Beta Colony. We don't actually know that he
hasn't...<br>

Lois. First I want to thank you for the great stories you’ve
written. Rereading books from the Vorkosigain saga always feel like
coming home. In the book Komarr, Miles mentions dealing with
bullies as a child. Are we ever going to see more of that story?
(Aral’s death was interesting in the way it affected those close to
him, but I miss the character. A young miles story could be a nice
way of revisiting him.)</a></div>

Although surely some analogous situations have cropped up in real

If you like science fiction, and are not allergic to a touch of
romance, start with <i>Shards of Honor</i>. If you like fantasy,
start with <i>The Curse of Chalion</i> or, for a shorter taste, the
novella "Penric's Demon".<br>

They put a new valve in her heart every 5 years, and each time they
told her and her family that she would be unlikely to survive the
five year life-span of the valve. If you were in a very quiet room
with her, you could hear the valve clicking. When you could not
hear it, it was not closing right and she would have to be

I've answered this one a bunch of times in a bunch of places, now
scattered to the winds of time I suppose. I really should fix
myself one of those canned-answer files for FAQs, but so far I've
been too lazy and disorganized. Iirc the intro to Baen's 30th
Anniversary trade paperback reprint of <i>The Warrior's
Apprentice</i> touches on it, also the Afterword to <i>Young
Miles</i>.<br>
<br>
No, I never have a clear idea how any character will turn out. In
general, I set them in motion and watch them go, like an AI
self-learning program. They will be created by their actions as
they progress. (Note that speech, too, is an action, as is internal
dialogue.)<br>
<br>
I don't know where folks think the contents of people's
imaginations come from, except from the world around them. It's not
an either/or proposition. Real-word inspirations include but are
not limited to young T. E. Lawrence, young Winston Churchill, my
own relationship with my own father, a physical (but not
psychological) template in a hospital pharmacist I used to work
with long ago, Aral's and Cordelia's personalities and situation,
and doubtless other sources now forgotten at a remove of, let's
see, Miles was initially created in 1984, so now almost 35
years.<br>
<br>
The first thing I knew about Miles, before his name or anything
else, was that he would be born to Aral and Cordelia physically
handicapped in some way, but very bright, on mutie-hostile
Barrayar. This was about halfway through the writing of <i>Shards
of Honor</i>. At that point, he was little more than a glowing blob
in my mind, or in Cordelia for that matter, but he got better.<br>
<br>
One might also note that the original first draft of <i>Shards of
Honor</i> actually went up through the soltoxin attack, but not
including the start of the war of the Pretendership. So up to the
end of Chapter 9 or thereabouts, don't remember exactly where I
broke off. I then cut backward to the present ending. When I went
to start <i>Barrayar</i> a number of years later, I wrote a new
Chapter One for the needed transition, laid in the 8 chapters I had
in hand, retyping and editing them, and went on from there. So for
a while, I knew a lot more detail about Miles's early start than
the readers did.<br>
<br>
Miles is not so much an outsider as a liminal figure, really,
existing on the borderlines of so many things, able to see, and be
pulled, in multiple directions.<br>

Ivan gets his honorific not from being heir to Count Falco, but for
being great-grandson of Prince Xav, and in a Certain Unstated
Relationship to the camp stool. Barrayaran titles don't have as
many quirky exceptions, which must be learned one by one and vary
with context, to their already ad hoc rules as, say, the English
language does, but there is a definite tendency in that
direction.<br>

your work thus far. I just got finished reading Memory and as I was
nearing the middle of it, I was hit by just how great it was, not

series so far. I've already started on Komarr. How much planning
goes into your novels? Are you a seat of the pants

Hm, some of these process questions are answered earlier in the
Q&amp;A column -- you might try scrolling back -- or in my
interviews. I would say my series are pretty ad hoc, building one
book at a time which always changes or channels the possibilities
for what follows. Within a book, I will have only a vague idea
where it's going; writing starts when the preliminary notes,
averaging about 50 pages, and whatever research reading I've done,
somehow make the opening scene/s rise up in my mind. I capture the
thoughts in penciled notes, then type them, shifting the
scene-block out of my mind to make room for the next wodge, and
repeat the process. So my planning is diffuse, not done
all-at-once.<br>
<br>
But I am not seat-of-my-pants as it is usually understood; I need
to have each scene I'm working on blocked out in notes, sequence of
events mostly nailed, dialogue roughly scripted, and choreography
roughly designed, before I sit at the keyboard. But only one scene
at a time, with a glimmer of what's next. Details are filled in,
sequences modified, items added or tossed, etc. editing as I
type.<br>
<br>
Lather, rinse, repeat till I reach the end.<br>
<br>

if as a result I end up with a stream of newbie writers of
completely unrelated items popping up here to covertly advertise

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, it's very
flattering, of course. And a little weird. Each reader has their
own construction of everything they read, and I don't think
academics are immune from this in any way. In fact, it's something
of their stock-in-trade. They are also writing within a genre,
Academic Writing, with its own genre conventions and agendas, with
certain boxes they are trained to tick, and which take some
learning to parse for a reader coming in from the outside. (Just as
in any other genre of writing, truth to tell.)<br>
<br>
Arguing with same bears for the writer the same hazards as
attempting to argue with any other review. One of the (fortunately)
early lessons in professional etiquette I was offered from an older
writer back in the 80s, and which seems only more pertinent now, is
never to respond to reviews except, perhaps, for an occasional
thank-you if someone says something especially nice. It's much
harder to stick by this wise rule in these days when reviews and
comments come not from a tiny handful of edited print columns, but
dumped out by the virtual truckload. And from a <i>much</i> wider
range of sources.<br>
<br>
I was given the chance to read this book in manuscript, by the way,
and offer corrections (iirc I tried to limit myself to those of
biographical or bibliographical fact) which was a nice courtesy to
receive.<br>

I've answered my-process questions in a lot of places, including
(somewhere) in this Q&amp;A file, so you might find more detail if
you hunt a bit. "Stumbling" happens all the time, I suppose, but I
do a lot of it before starting to type out first drafts, in my
notes-and-outlines phase, which also get constantly redeveloped as
I go. The worst part of a book or story for me is not the
beginning, but the middle. Middles are the pits. So I suppose I
manage bit by bit, breaking down the process to chewable bites.<br>
<br>
Separate from the actual writing is all the business stuff --
contracts, deadlines, promotional duties -- which can add stress
depending. Which is why one of the conditions of my current
semi-retirement is to neither contract nor announce new work, if
any, till the first draft is bagged. (It's normal business practice
not to publicly discuss any contract or other negotiations till
they're over. Since many of us writers are sort of raised by
wolves, business etiquette, too, can take some learning.)<br>

Pat Wrede had a good post recently on the topic --<br>

I've been wondering about nonromantic relationships in your
writing. It seems to me your intense friendships pretty much all
have complex power dynamics -- you don't do simple strong
friendship without either romance, or guardianship and authority
and different sorts of control? Am I wrong about that, and if not
are there conscious reasons for it? (I really enjoy the way you do
handle power dynamics, btw.)</a></div>

I don't think you are right, but perhaps you are not thinking over
a wide enough array of my characters. Other commenters might find
this an interesting enough question to chime in with their takes
below. Miles and Ivan? Claire and Silver? Barr and Remo? Cordelia
and Alys? Penric, Inglis, and Oswyl? None would seem to fall into
the range of what I take you to be thinking. (I'm not actually sure
just what, or who, you're thinking about, here, actually. For one
thing almost no one who talks about power ever stops to define the
term, always dangerous in a debate.)<br>
<br>
A lot of the stories do include characters who have to step up to
larger responsibilities than had fallen to their lots heretofore.
That's usually called "character development", though.<br>

reviews, answers to questions, and other posts here on Goodreads!
Thank you. I just read The Flowers of Vashnoi and am curious - were
the characters and plot centered around the radioactive zone at all
influenced by the 3-11 Fukushima reactor meltdown incident in Japan
(as it still continues to pan out, and the various effects are
being felt/researched/etc)? <a class=

I first came up with Vashnoi in 1984, when I was writing <i>The
Warrior's Apprentice</i>, so it predates not only Fukushima but
also Chernobyl. (But not, of course Hiroshima and Nagasaki.) It was
built in broad outline back then, including the idea that there
would be people occupying it extra-legally, and other people whose
jobs it would be to chase them out. The recent story was further
informed by information about Chernobyl -- I particularly rec the
PBS show from a few years back with the irresistible title of
"Radioactive Wolves".<br>

and pursuing immortality; they partake of something human crossed
with something nonhuman. They do seem to have something insectoid
in their makeup, but it may also include theft of aspects from the

By that I'm guessing you mean the author's deliberate intent. I
don't think character growth is spontaneous; it is usually a result
of the story-so-far, which is why the writer has bothered to put
all that stuff on the page in the first place.<br>
<br>
Whether surrender-of-the-self-to-the-greater is right or not will
depend on the character and their particular story (and their
particular "greater", not to mention what is meant by "surrender".)
Very easily it might be the reverse, a character recognizing that
whatever they had identified as their greater actually wasn't, and
should instead be ignored or resisted.<br>
<br>
Miles has a descant on it somewhere, to the effect that true
destiny does not consume, but rather, returns an enlarged self. If
something consumes with no return, one may be in unrecognized
trouble.<br>

It sounds as if you might need a new beta reader. They do wear out,
over time; nothing lasts forever. (Although a writer can wear them
out faster by making them read repeated revisions, something to be
avoided.) Nor is any given beta reader suitable for all works.
Also, no one will ever be as interested in your own writing as you
are (rather naturally) so expecting them to somehow carry you goes
beyond what one can reasonably ask from a crit.<br>
<br>
I don't know about courage, but if you want <i>information</i> the
resource I recommend is this: <a target="_blank" rel=

https://www.amazon.com/Wrede-Writing-...</a><br>
<br>
Scattered through are a number of useful and sensible posts on
coping with critique problems, from both sides.<br>
<br>
Financial concerns likely need to be addressed separately, though
also sensibly -- no one in the modern world can live without money,
the more independently obtained the better -- and are outside of my
range.<br>

my process in a number of places, including earlier in this column

But briefly, setting, plot, and character form feedback loops as I
go; any of the three have served as start-points in different
books, but character tends to be the most important for driving
things forward. I use a rolling outline, a mess of general notes
followed by scene-by-scene penciled memory aids that are halfway
between notes and rough drafts, one scene at a time as I write.
(Thinking it up and writing it down are two different phases for
me, and the notes capture the thinking-it-up parts.) No way could I
hold a whole book in my head on Day One; the next scene is about
all I can manage, lather, rinse, repeat till done.<br>

Ivar is new to me, but you have to figure, every medical condition
that exists now existed in the past, if with different names and
explanations. (Except the ones that used to kill at birth or early
on.) Thankfully many old killers have been rendered more rare by
sanitation, immunizations, sterile technique (ferex tetanus used to
take out a lot of infants from dirty cuts of the umbilical cord)
and better understanding of nutrition. Grant you, osteogenesis

Grover's great. My agent adores his voice work.<br>
<br>
I'm not much of a listener, but I've found my reading app on my
tablet computer turns every book (well, every e-book) into a
larger-print book, which has been a boon, lately.<br>

Good question, which I would probably need a book to stop and work
out. Although Inglis, if not a saint, certainly earned his god's
attention at the end of "Penric and the Shaman". He also had a
cameo in <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i>.<br>
<br>
But yes, there should be saints of the son; His turf being
comradeship, the hunt, autumn harvest, there should be room to
speculate.<br>
<br>
"Guardian of young males" tends to be a pretty thankless task, but
someone's got to do it. Five gods know they need it. Also a good
question where, aside from biological fatherhood, the two gods
would have their hand-off of allegiance.<br>

No, the lovely Catherine Asaro ably represented me at the Hugos

up here next week. I'll make a blog post when it does, if I can

I'm going to stick with "World of the Five Gods" for story covers
and ad copy, myself, but the fans may devise what they please. It
was being abbreviated 5GU, for Five Gods Universe, a while back,

scholarly to restore, from the manuscript, a line omitted from a

by a confusing line from an earlier chapter. Do you have any

I last read Leinster in, probably, grade school, so my memory of
his work is compost by now. I have a dim association with some sort
of space medical drama, if I'm not munging him with his
contemporary Alan Nourse. Or James White, tho' the tales I read by
him are more distinct, even at this remove.<br>

I don't remember, but I expect the book is widely available through
Project Gutenberg, not to mention public libraries, so I expect you
could find the reference with a short search.<br>

Blurbs are solicited at all three levels. I have in the past, when
my books were in the production stage, had my editors ask me for a
list of likely candidates to send pre-publication copies to for
remarks. It is up to the editors to decide which of the ones they
then get back to put on covers. I don't think anyone ever suggests
what to say to the blurber, but since space on a cover is tight,
it's common to select just the most useful-looking phrases from
whatever has been offered.<br>
<br>
My indie ebooks don't require blurbs on their "covers", though we
recycle old ones onto the vendor pages where appropriate, or new
ones taken from professional reviews. (Which are another source:
Publisher's Weekly, YALSA, and Booklist are all
names-to-be-recognized, especially by purchasing librarians.)<br>
<br>
Anne McCaffrey's nice blurb came through Baen, with whom she had a
close working relationship. (It may have been on the back of a
postcard she'd mailed from her Mediterranean vacation, but I don't
remember for sure.) Peg Kerr was in a writer's group with me at the
time, so I'd already read the book in manuscript, making that one
easy.<br>
<br>
I decline requests for blurbs all the time these days, rather
shamefacedly as I benefited from them in the past, but I have eye
issues that curtail my reading time. So I'm rationing it for
either, first, work on my computer, or second, whatever is left
goes to things I've chosen, usually on my tablet. Enlargeable
fonts, yay!<br>

I don't think I said that anywhere -- got a link?<br>
<br>
It is in the back rooms of my mind that Ingrey and Ijada are
ancestors of Inglis, though. And Oswin an ancestor of Oswyl. The
two stories are about half-a-dozen generations apart.<br>

Yes, rule is that to be nominated a series has to have a new work
published in the award year.<br>
<br>
Not that it matters. Although <i>The Sharing Knife</i> has its own
cadre of loyal readers, it doesn't seem to have been as widely
popular with the Worldcon crowd as my other two series.<br>

Hm. In general, I lay no claim to being a futurist, although it's
always fun to be right twice a day. I'm not sure what you mean by
"you would love to go after if you were younger" -- as a writer? As
a student? As a patient? (This week, I want a noninvasive cure for
macular pucker, if I get a pick.)<br>
<br>
For anyone interested in prognostication, I'd say keep an eye on
biology. Where any pop sci books published more than five years ago
are now out of date, as are some that were published one year ago.
Or last week. The explosion in biology itself, of course, stems
heavily from the explosion in computing and communication. Progress
is happening all over in a 3D or maybe 4D web, not in a line, which
makes any linear extrapolation, the favorite of many (but not me),
almost bound to be incorrect.<br>
<br>
This seems like a good topic to throw open to the comments

To answer in order, I have begun to believe writing fiction is
actually a high-level dissociative disorder. Besides that,
certainly the <i>material</i> for a story comes from everything the
writer has ever done, read, watched, or experienced. What forms
that material gets shaped into will depend on the writers' internal
psychological needs, or interests, and what material they have
encountered. (Starting, at the most fundamental level, with what
language/s they speak, and what forms of story their culture
presents them with.)<br>
<br>
I suspect imagination begins almost as early as consciousness and
memory -- what children have not played "Let's pretend!"? -- but
certainly I was making up scraps of story by grade school, and
writing them down by junior high. My writing that was good enough,
and original enough, to make the grade of professional publication
began in my early 30s, after I had acquired more learning and life
experience to draw upon.<br>
<br>
More (than you wanted to know) may be found in my nonfiction
collection <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i>, or in the interviews
section on the Vorkosigan wiki, <a target="_blank" rel=

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Okay! I see I
am confronted this morning with five nearly identical sets of
questions to the most recent answered, all apparently from the same
high school class, and therefore an assignment. My friend who
writes YA gets tons of these, and they are a great burden on the
target author -- teachers should be made aware that it is unfair to
make a kid's grade hinge on this, and teachers really shouldn't do
it to any writer from whom they have not first asked and received
permission. But one can't blow off kids, so.<br>
<br>
I will treat them as one unit, and only answer non-duplicating
questions. Classmates, if you click my Q&amp;A column into "newest
first" order, at the button on the upper right, you should be able
to see them all grouped, albeit in reverse order than I answered
them.<br>
<br>
<i>First</i> of all, many of these questions have been answered
previously in this very column, at greater length. If you scroll
down to the beginning and read up, you will find them. More is
available free online (this being what it is, free online seems the
way to go) at the Vorkosigan wiki, <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"http://vorkosigan.wikia.com/wiki/Author_Interviews">http://vorkosigan.wikia.com/wiki/Auth...</a>
Not to mention my Wikipedia entry, and those of my books and
characters. (I find it a source of great amusement to reflect that
<i>my</i> imaginary friends have their own Wikipedia entries...<br>
<br>
But, of course, I gather that the purpose of the assignment is not
"learn this material", but rather, "practice writing a letter".
(And possibly in a 2nd language, which deserves respect.) So.<br>
<br>
Breaking out questions in order received:<br>
<br>
"Can you recommend any new or upcoming authors to us?"<br>
<br>
I'm very fond of Megan Whalen Turner's series starting with <i>The
Thief</i>. That would keep you going for five books right there. I
can also rec the works of Patricia C. Wrede -- her <i>The Enchanted
Forest Chronicles</i> are very popular. Neither of these are
exactly new, as I don't keep up with even my own genre. Now that
I'm blogging on Goodreads, which makes it easy, I've taken to
dropping short reviews of whatever I happen to have read, which you
can find here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7672661">https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...</a><br>

<br>
Naturally, they are not filtered for children, since I am 68. Lots
of manga lately, in part due to improved access, in part due to my
eye issues.<br>
<br>
"What keeps you motivated during creative slumps?"<br>
<br>
Formerly, running out of money. Half a story is about as
economically useful as half a bridge. These days, as well as
formerly, a story demands its own completion. Think of an
unfinished story as like an imaginary splinter in the mind, which
cannot heal till the thing is <i>out</i>.<br>
<br>
"How did you come up with the idea for your book?"<br>
<br>
Oh, dear, <i>such</i> an assignment question. Don't worry, I don't
blame you. But it is not answerable unless you specify which of my
30 or so works you are asking about. Conveniently, your classmate
has already asked it in a more general way: answer here. <a target=
"_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1415393-thank-your-for-responding-here-s-my">
https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1...</a><br>
<br>
An additional note to pass on to teachers generally: if you are
doing this, and have one or a few target authors, get the kids who
are targeting the chosen author together in groups to collate their
questions and send them as one letter, not six or sixteen
near-duplicates. Alternately, some teachers do the collating
themselves as a class exercise. (This also has the privacy
advantage that the return address can be to the school, when this
is done on paper or even email, not all the kids' homes or home
e-addys.) My YA-writing friends are pathetically grateful to
teachers who think to do their assignments this way.<br>
<br>
(And Angelley, good luck on your reading and writing!)<br>

"Do you find it hard writing books?"<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>

"Where can you find most of your ideas?"<br>
<br>
Answered here, among other places: <a target="_blank" rel=

https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1...</a><br>
<br>
"And for most of your stories, Do you see yourself as the main
character?"<br>
<br>
No, my stories are not written as self-inserts. Most of them
explore very different lives than my own. That said, <i>all</i> my
characters, major and minor, hero or villain, have to come in some
sense out of my own mind, experience, and knowledge. Until I have
internalized a character to some degree, I cannot know what they
will say when they open their mouth to speak, let alone what they
will do or how they will react in a given situation.<br>
<br>
I've also described this as stepping into a character's
skin/body/mind and wrapping it around me, but it's their skin, not
mine.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you in your reading and writing...<br>

<br>
Breaking out your questions in order,<br>
<br>
"First... Do you view writing as a spiritual practice?"<br>
<br>
Ah, there's a different question, very good. No, not as such, but
writing by its nature entails enormous amounts of self-reflection
and self-awareness, if sometimes in a rather dissociative way. It
also depends on how one defines "spiritual", and whether it is to
be sought outside the self or within the self, or both.<br>
<br>
"What period of your life you started writing most often?"<br>
<br>
Answered in part here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"
href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1415393-thank-your-for-responding-here-s-my">
https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1...</a> But certainly my early
30s were when I grew serious about productivity. It wasn't just a
hobby at that point.<br>
<br>
"Third.. How did you come up with the idea? "<br>
<br>
Duplicate question, answered in the link/s above.<br>
<br>
"How long does it take you to write a book?"<br>
<br>
Mine have varied from ten months to four years, depending on
pressure and interruptions.<br>

Your last question was cut off by the character limit of the
questions box. If it is not a duplicate, you may ask it again.<br>

Last in the queue, you unfortunate student...<br>
<br>
See here <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1416048-good-day-ma-am-hi-i-m-angelley-ragasa">
https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1...</a> and linked for
more.<br>
<br>
"How did it start ma'am?"<br>
<br>
A great many questions about my early writing career are answered
earlier in this column -- scroll down -- in my interviews
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://vorkosigan.wikia.com/wiki/Author_Interviews">http://vorkosigan.wikia.com/wiki/Auth...</a>
, in my nonfiction work <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i>, and in
<i>The Vorkosigan Companion</i>.<br>
<br>
But really, I think all imaginative creation starts in childhood
with "Let's pretend!" games, and goes on to thinking imaginatively
about fiction one has read or watched. From there it's a very short
jump to wanting to make such creations oneself. (Fanfiction is
frequently a normal first step, depending on the models one has
encountered.)<br>
<br>
"What or who are your inpirations?"<br>
<br>
Really this goes back to modeling, referenced above. A huge amount
of human learning happens through modeling, copying the thing done
by another whether the thing is how to throw a volleyball or how to
write a story. Short answer would be "All the fiction I have read
and liked." Specifics are answered elsewhere as per references. (Do
I need to say, copy does not mean plagiarize -- it means making
one's very own thing after the mode demonstrated.)<br>
<br>
"How do you feel while writing your stories ?"<br>
<br>
Since stories can take up to years to compete, quite a few things.
I'm always most excited to be either beginning or ending a piece;
the middles are always a slog.<br>
<br>
"What books you can recomend on us?"<br>
<br>
Answered elsewhere in this batch, and in this column.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your further reading and writing --<br>
<br>
Ta, L.</span></div>

Yes, it is contracted to SubPress and in the production pipeline. I
believe it's scheduled for sometime next summer. (It's not up on
their site for preorder yet.) When I get a firm date, I will post

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The "what
inspires" question was asked and answered generally elsewhere in
this batch from your classmates. The not-quite-facetious answer is
that I think writing fiction is a dissociative disorder; the more
economic, my need for a job I could blend with care of my two
preschool children in the middle of the recession of 1982 in a
small town in Ohio. After that, there was a reward feedback loop --
people like <i>this</i> thing, do more.<br>
<br>
What I want to say to the people who read my stories are the
stories themselves. Anything else, including all PR (publicity --
like this blog, for example), is, as one of my characters quips
somewhere, persiflage, camouflage, or just plain flage. It's why I
prefer, when I'm forced to write anything, to write Afterwords not
introductions. Some writers want to be famous. I want not to get in
the way of the stories.<br>
<br>
That said, a minimum amount of fame is required to sell anything;
people at least have to be able to remember and spell a writer's
name in order to find their books. (For the record, again, Bujold
is my surname and B is the letter my books should be shelved under.
The McMaster is my maiden name that I use as my middle name. No
hyphens.)<br>

No, I haven't written about it, so you haven't missed anything.
Among the unsettled but likely possibilities are that appointments
automatically end with an emperor's death, requiring the new
sitting emperor to re-up the appointment or allowing him to clean
the slate and start over with his own choices, or some mix of both.
Interregnums or more than one person being declared emperor by
assorted factions opens yet more possibilities for hijinks.<br>

Yes, and not Miles. There are plenty of other senior people in the
Empire who might step up to the plate in the less fraught times
than those Ezar and Aral faced. Laisa or Laisa-plus-small Regency
Council -- Laisa, somebody senior military, somebody senior civil
government being one of many possibilities.<br>

So glad you've found Penric! I don't know if the notion of a court
jester or allowed fool is in circulation in the realms around
Chalion et. al. -- they don't have knights or knighthood, after
all. But if so, the job might well have affiliation with the
Bastard (though not in Quadrene lands). The individual could have
their personal soul's allegiance to any of the gods, depending, and
their degree of religious devotion or lack of same, too, would vary
with the person.<br>

I've answered this one before, a couple of times, earlier in the
Q&amp;A column; scroll down. But to recap, pretty much everyone who
was published in <i>Analog Magazine</i> in the 60s, and whatever I
could find on my libraries' shelves during that decade. Worth
particular mention are Cordwainer Smith, Poul Anderson, Randall
Garrett, Anne McCaffrey, Zenna Henderson, L. Sprague de Camp and
Fletcher Pratt, Eric Frank Russell, Tolkien of course, early
Zelazny, and Fritz Leiber.<br>
<br>
When I started writing, I had the most help from Patricia C. Wrede
and Lillian Stewart Carl. (By that point, reading nonfiction became
more useful for inspiring stories.)<br>

While I may have run such thoughts through my mind, if not often,
I've never had the time or energy to divert to writing anything
like that out. If I can write (or even imagine) at all, I'd rather
be writing pay copy that I can actually share.<br>
<br>
Littering the mental roadside along the way are doubtless the
desiccated corpses of story ideas that never gained traction and
were superceded, but I don't give them much brain room either.<br>

It's a real Danish (iirc) man's name, meaning "day". And it's
short, making two marks in its favor. I first saw it in the news
attached to Dag Hammer...(schold, skold, it's been a half century)
who was Secretary-General of the UN back in the 50s or 60s, who
seemed vaguely heroic to my young mind.<br>
<br>
I'm also told, much more recently, that it's a slang Aussie term
for the clumps of soil dangling from a sheep's hind end, so I
likely won't use it again. Sadly.<br>

I have no idea where you could have heard of a new Miles book
coming out; it is not so. (If this is a misconstrual about the
untitled, unfinished novella I read from at Dreamhaven last night,
that was set in the world of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>. No idea when
or if it will be finished, though.)<br>
<br>
As for the rest, some of it may be a job for Fanficwoman. But it is
always heartening to hear that my characters seem to have lives

"/questions/1440444-i-loved-novels-starring-cordelia-who-is">I
loved novels starring Cordelia, who is my favorite character in the
series, and was wondering if any more are planned, particularly
ones focusing just on her? I also particularly loved the Cetaganda
novel, so any chance of something like that in the future, perhaps
one more heavily Cetagandan in POV? Thanks!</a></div>

If you are asking about reading in general, the people answering,
perhaps in the comments section below, would need to know things
like your reading level, whether English is your first or second
language, and what sorts of books you like already, or some similar
clues to your tastes, to guide you toward some likely-to-be-happy
choices.<br>

stylistic questions, the answer is It Depends. I would say Sally,
but whether you could make that work would depend on how smoothly
you set up the transition in and out of the flashback, embedding
the necessary clues and traffic signals for the reader. Which might
depend in turn on what reason your point-of-view character is
channeling the memories of another person or personality.<br>

Sure, but I try to limit the impulse to typos or clear infelicities
of grammar or construction. Plus the occasional adverb kill or
extirpation of a word-echo, or regularizing capitalization or
spelling of neologisms. In earlier passes, I spent a lot of time
tidying italics, as for mechanical reasons I'd avoided them in my
first few works. (My daisy-wheel printer used to jam when going
back over lines to underline, the then-current method of signalling
to the (human!) typesetter that the word was to be italicized when
the pages were composited. Instead I had to go over every page with
a straight-edge and pen to hand-enter them. Also earlier with my
old electric typewriter and carbons, though I forget what its
problem was with backing up to underline. Electronic files now make
this concern obsolete, yay!)<br>
<br>
Perpetually rewriting old books is a temptation to be resisted,
first because it would be a bottomless task that would swallow all
new work, second because that other Lois of 20 or more years ago
was another person, and I don't exactly have the right to alter her
work. Though once in a great while I find a line has been widely
misread or misconstrued by some significant number of readers, and
I have to think hard about whether to violate that historical
principle. Words changing their meanings or usage over generational
time is yet another thorny problem.<br>
<br>
The temptation is automatically limited with works on paper, as
changes can only be made when a new edition is printed. E-books,
argh.<br>

and I share a love of your books. I have all of your Penric
novellas in ebook, but she only reads print. I would love to give
her the novellas for her 80th bday, but Penric's Demon is not in
print...so I can't even get her started. Do you know if it is going
to be back in print any time soon? I have searched online and can
only find one used copy for $190...which is a little out of my
price range :)</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>A print edition
is planned, or rather, two collections of three novellas each, but
they will likely not be in time for a birthday before late next
year. I will post on my blog when all is finalized and there are
more details to impart.<br>
<br>
Speaking as an older reader, I'm adoring my tablet computer (an
Android Pixel C, in my case) with Kindle app for most of my own
reading these days. It turns every e-book into a large print book
(eye issues, argh), and is lighter and easier to hold than any
paper book (arthritis issues, also argh. I prop mine up on a
cushion on my lap and don't have to hold it at all.) The initial
learning curve -- tap <i>where?</i> -- was as usual maddening, but
with a few days' practice became entirely worthwhile. (Mine taught
me some moves to manage my soon-added Smartphone, as well.) And a
general-purpose tablet is not limited to the Kindle app. For a gift
that keeps on giving, you might, if your budget extends (or can be
combined with siblings') think about giving her a tablet for
reading. And, if you are especially good and techie children,
setting it all up for her. (My son did mine for me, heh.)<br>
<br>
Other advantages: being able to check out or return library e-books
for free, any time day or night, without having to drive anywhere;
ditto buying books, pulling them out of the air. There are also
thousands of older classic books up for free, many also readily
accessible through the Kindle app.<br>
<br>
Ta, Lois.</span></div>

into several such. Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series sticks in
my mind. Sherlock Holmes and Peter Wimsey are only historical by
default, these days. There are actually rather a lot of
fantasy-mystery crossovers out there, since one must give one's
characters <i>something</i> to do, and Great War for the Fate of
the World stories are getting really old.<br>
<br>
For an older but still splendid entry in the genre, I expect the
Lord Darcy stories by Randall Garrett still hold up.<br>
<br>
The trick with a fantasy mystery, I think, is that there be a
fantasy element both integral and fair in the mystery part.<br>

Coincidence; I barely watched that era of Star Trek. But notions of
various sorts of spiritual or alien body possession or sharing have
been kicking around fantasy and SF since before they were even
genres. For earlyish examples on the SF side, Heinlein's <i>The
Puppet Masters</i> for a negative, Hal Clement's <i>Needle</i> for
a positive spin, both of which I read back in the 60s. For fantasy,
too numerous to list. Who knows how many variations in anime by
now.<br>
<br>
Not a new or unique idea. Whatever freshness any given writer may
bring to it is all in the details. On the other hand, no one
complains that they've already read one story about a human being,
they don't need to read any more...<br>

respect to uterine replicators, would the mother-to-be still have

something that popped into my head, wondering how nursing would fit

The Vorkosiverse would certainly have it within easy options to
medically arrange the mother's (or wet-nurse's) hormones however
she or it pleased. (*) Well-understood biology, by that time. In
most places, it would be considered a personal choice.<br>
<br>
There would also be the option of vat-made human milk, I have no
doubt. (Or any other kind.)<br>
<br>
* - Also, Athos. Who knows what they consider culturally normal,
though I'd bet on vat milk there. Probably.<br>

You are entirely welcome!<br>
<br>
It's good to know the series still holds up for new readers in a
new millennium, so many years after its inception. (It takes me
aback to realize this series is now older than some of its readers.
If you were born after 1982 for first writing, or 1986 for first
publication. That's... getting to be a lot of people.)<br>

You need to read <i>Shards of Honor</i> more carefully. It's all in
there, some by implication.<br>
<br>
Note also that none of the following books are from Cordelia's
viewpoint. This closely shapes and constrains what information
leaks through. Miles doesn't actually know everything about
everything, as much as he would like to; or else the stories don't
touch on Cordelia at all, being off-planet or whatever. After a
certain point, she would also have been reticent for Jole's sake,
as was Aral.<br>
<br>
Viewpoint matters, people. Hugely. (At least in tight-third or
first person narratives. In real life, too.)<br>

This question makes the odd assumption that there is a singular
answer. But to answer in full would take typing out my entire
biography, which there is no space (nor endurance) to do here.<br>
<br>
However, if you scroll back through this Q&amp;A column, you will
find a lot of similar questions asked and answered previously,
which should cover it. (Since there are something like 600+ entries
so far, this should keep you busy for a while.)<br>

legal reasons, do you have to stay completely clear of fan-fiction
related to your books/novellas? I'm wondering if you ever get a
glimpse of their canonical and non-canonical writing? There are
some quite inspired fan authors that we readers have the freedom to
enjoy. I wonder what restrictions you have.</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>There used to
be an alarming theory that writers should be required to actively
extirpate fan fiction or lose their own rights, but really, about
ten million fanfics have been written about Harry Potter, and no
one (sane) is arguing that J. K. Rowling does not therefore possess
her own copyrights. The concern, I think, belongs to a previous
technological era. Nuisance lawsuits can happen to anyone,
anywhere, for any reason, so I don't think pro writers are
especially vulnerable.<br>
<br>
Actual plagiarism in professionally published media is covered
under a different set of laws and social rules.<br>
<br>
Hollywood is another smoke, with a much larger audience having
therefore a much larger number, if not necessarily percentage, of
nutbars in it, and more money in play to attract predators and
scavengers. Production companies are picky about clear rights for
valid historical reasons.<br>
<br>
Also, the boundaries are too fuzzy to sensibly identify. What about
filk? Poetry? Alternate Universe or Crossover fics? Unlikely porn?
The list goes on. I certainly consider filk fair game, for
starters.<br>
<br>
Note that there could be no restriction I can imagine on me reading
fanfic in <i>other</i> fandoms... :-)<br>

Yep, it's centered around winter solstice on Barrayar. It is also
connected with some sort of intercalary week/10 days/Saturnalia
that is inserted every year to make the Earth-origin 12-month
calendar come out even with the actual revolution of the planet
around its sun. (At one point I posited, but never used, the notion
that every Barrayaran month is exactly 4 weeks/28 days, leaving
some more time to adjust at the end.) The whole fudge-factor period
is also dubbed "Winterfair".<br>

Jole was first developed in 1989, when he popped into <i>The Vor
Game</i> and was so vibrant and suggestive despite his short time
on stage. The strong possibility occurred to me then, but that
wasn't what that (or subsequent) books were about so it remained
more imagined potential than developed. The Sergyar section of any
of the characters' biographies couldn't occur till I decided to
send Aral and Cordelia off to Sergyar when I wrote <i>Memory</i> in
the mid 90s.<br>
<br>
Following VK books had other characters and business, not to
mention settings, to explore, and then there was that long stretch
entirely away from the series when I was writing the two fantasy
series. So it didn't switch from potential to kinetic till after
that. And then the relationships finally became thematically and
plot relevant to the book at hand, aka "more fun with uterine
replicators: the next generation (-al shift)", with both gender and
generational issues to explore versus the technology, in
<i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i> and so Jole went, a bit
belatedly, to center stage. (Because, you know, for all the
character-and-relationship drama, this <i>is</i> supposed to be
science fiction, here.)<br>

'Mirror Dance', I was just out of Premed, and our psychology
professor had vividy described anorexia nervosa, where the
adolescent uses her own body to obtain control that the overbearing
family otherwise denies her. Mark's coping mechanism is quite
similar, regaining a measure of control that way. Did you come up
with this on your own, or did you actually use current research?
Both would be quite impressive!</a></div>

Mark came mainly from, well, insight into Mark. He is largely his
own invention, in more ways than one. (Also from my own notions
about the fundamental biological bases of behavior.) Since the book
was written in the early 90s -- 1992 - 93 -- I'll have to acquit me
of using "current" research. Or even then-current research, beyond
what leaked in from the general culture.<br>

Any actual sequel would just spawn fractal possibilities for other
sequels, so short of blowing up the galaxy, which seems wasteful,
there is no "end".<br>
<br>
Though there is fanfiction out there, if you're desperate.<br>
<br>
I'd actually like to get back to Penric, myself, but I don't have
the pieces I need to settle on a specific tale yet.<br>

"Name TBA" novella-ish evades any novella award category because of
its length; novel category ditto. It's off the hook for that
straight out of the gate.<br>
<br>
No word on audio or a print version -- it hasn't even been finished
in final revision (my least favorite part of writing, urgh, so
there is some loin-girding yet to go, here) and submitted, let
alone contracted, after all. Neither are unlikely, but no news is
no news. When there <i>is</i> news, I shall certainly post it.<br>

New Year Lois. My question is that I have recently published my
first book (Redemption My Father's Story) and I used Covenant Books
Publishing. The editing is terrible. It's distracting to the
reader. I just am at a loss of how to handle this and could use
some advice. I know that they sent it to me for approval and I
regret that. I'm in no way an editor and I told them that. Any
thoughts, please?</a></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I am going to
throw this one open to the commenters, since I have no idea what
sort of publisher, or scam, Covenant Books may be. Normal
publishers allow the writer to make corrections at the line-edit,
the copy-edit, and the page-proof stage. Which are up to the writer
to make good. If you did not do so, the result is on you, not
them.<br>
<br>
(There are horror tales of messes occurring between page-proof
approval and publication, which other published writers will have
to supply; I've been mostly lucky. Except on a few reprints where,
because they were setting from old files, I didn't think I'd need
to read the page proofs again, wrong, sigh.)<br>
<br>
Although I am not entirely sure whether you are referring to actual
editing, where the line editor makes substantive suggestions to
improve the work that the writer carries out (or elects not to, or
comes up with alternate fixes), or copy-editing, where minor errata
are addressed, or final page proofs, after final formatting and
typesetting, to winkle out the last typos and similar glitches.
(The next stop is Readers' Eyes, at which point it is Too
Late.)<br>
<br>
But, really, learning to edit your own material is one of the basic
tasks and duties of a writer. Because you can't trust anyone else,
even at a pro publisher. If you can't send in a manuscript as close
to camera-ready as humanly possible... then you need to go over it
again. Yourself. Though perhaps with help from friends or a crit
group, or whatever online resources you can access for your
specific weak issues.<br>

Hm, hard to answer, since much of my writing is intuitive rather
than consciously constructed. But I suppose decades of direct
observation of people (especially including myself), personal
experience, doings; more at a remove, reading, watching, listening
and more reading. My theories of human behavior are based to the
degree my understanding allows in the patterns of the deep
biological and bio-social substrate of all primate humans, as
contrasted with particular cultures or associations (although the
group dynamics of all kinds of human associations and how and why
they assemble themselves is itself a study.) "Accidents versus
essences" is the way I sometimes shorthand it for myself. Or,
"Culture is what biology uses to clothe itself." And, sometimes, to
disguise itself.<br>
<br>
Also, do keep in mind, when you are reading certainly fiction but
also nonfiction as well, what you are experiencing is not the
world, but the inside of another writer's head. Which is a thing to
be marveled at in itself, but, as the old saying goes, the map is
not the territory.<br>

"/questions/1495635-one-of-my-favorite-relationships-is-that">One
of my favorite relationships is that between Penric and Llewyn
though we only get to see it a few times. I've always wondered if
there is something more intimate between Llewyn and her secretary
than that between employer and employee. I feel like you almost
hint so, but I might just need better glasses for reading between
the lines. Also, could Desdemona have chatted with Llewyn while
Penric was asleep-in theory?</a></div>

Yes, I'd like to do more with Penric and his Princess-Archdivine
sometime, though no obvious plot has yet reported for duty, only
insufficient bits. The nice thing about ala carte e-publishing is
that it doesn't set a series order in stone, or print. I can jump
around anywhere in Pen's timeline if I want.<br>
<br>
I will leave more intimate personal speculation about Llewyn and
her long-time faithful secretary and friend to the fanficcers,
methinks. Note they are both sworn members of the Daughter's Order,
not the Bastard's Order, fwiw.<br>
<br>
Des seems to go off-line when Penric is unconscious or asleep, cut
off from the world just as he is. It might be the first sign of a
demon, oops, ascending to take over the sorcerer's body if the
demon could seize the wheel during unconsciousness, Jekyll & Hyde
fashion, but that speculation is not established in text at this
time.<br>

Er, which one?<br>
<br>
If you are referring to the just-published "Knife Children", it's
about 52,000 words. Structurally, functionally, and in price a
novella, though a tad overweight for the official category.<br>
<br>
If anything else, you'll have to specify.<br>

I think you want an actual biologist or biology/evolution pop sci
or scientific book/article to answer this question, and as recent
as possible -- basically, anything published in the biological
sciences more than five years old is likely to be out of date.
Sometimes, more than one year old. But the peculiarities of human
mating cycles compared to the other primates have been
commented-upon since, gosh, Desmond Morris? Speaking of out-of-date
pop sci.<br>
<br>
I briefly met Le Guin exactly once, at a convention many years ago,
so cannot pretend to speak for her in any way. Note, though, that
in most works of fiction there will be at least two levels,
representation and metaphor, and it is as well not to confuse one
with the other.<br>

Nothing planned at this time.<br>
<br>
Re: your other question, others on the internet would be more up to
date on these PR issues than I am.<br>
<br>
On that head, I've lately received a slew of stealth attempts to
parasitize my blog or Q&amp;A with covert ads, links, and
promotions for other people's totally unrelated books. I thought
the first few might just be clueless newbies with bad netiquette,
but as they've kept coming I suspect someone is telling new writers
to do things like this. Don't.<br>

I don't choose books to review. I just choose books to read, and if
I've read it, I figure I might as well toss up a review if there's
anything of interest to say about it. Goodreads' function makes it
easy, which is why I started.<br>

there is one, I don't review anything I did not finish, and I don't

Thank you for your attentive reading! What people get out of my
prose does depend to a degree on what they bring to it.<br>
<br>
No, it's not consciously done, exactly. I do feel any paragraph
should spill out, at the end, someplace further on than where it
began, and therefore most sentences, from which paragraphs are
made, must do so, or link up to do so, as well. Making each
paragraph a unit of change in the story, if you will: in motion.
And I do spend a lot of time in the editing passes improving word
choice, sometimes for purely mechanical reasons like fixing word
echoes, sometimes to sharpen characterization or world-building.
But I don't think of that as anything other than just writing.<br>

I did think, for a while early in the writing, that Barr and Lily

Well, as I've said elsewhere, I do rolling revisions now I'm
working paperless, so there is no real boundary between drafts.
(This does tend to result in more editing and micro-editing of the
earliest parts than the latest.) Finding "the end" is done as much
by feel as anything; I know it when I see it. I also collect an
array of test reads, aka beta reads, both during and at the end,
which gives me a mirror in which to see the work when my own eyes
don't focus anymore.<br>
<br>
The final editing pass is always a very nervous proposition. I've
described late edits and changes as like trying to swap out one
card in the second layer of an eight-layer house of cards.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I can tell the end is nigh by exhaustion; mood
swings viz the work, from delight to hostility and back (though
those go on in the middle as well); noting that changes are
starting to muddy rather than clarify; and the ever-popular "change
it and then change it back, lather, rinse, repeat" syndrome, all of
which are signals that it's time to be done.<br>
<br>
Deadlines, wanting the fun of publication, or the call of a new
story also motivate putting the keyboard down and backing away.
However, the phrase "a story is never finished, only abandoned" is
one of those great truths. My daughter, a metals artist, also put
it strikingly when she described a finished piece as "a series of
decisions that I stopped making."<br>

asking how I do it, or how you should do it?<br>
<br>
If the latter, there are a number of good posts going back on Pat
Wrede's blog that address the art of critique, both giving and
receiving it:<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/">http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/</a><br>
<br>
It may take a while to find them, but it will be time well
spent.<br>
<br>
Ah, better. When I typed "critique" into the blog's search box, I
got all these, which might speed things up.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=critique">https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=critique</a><br>

<br>
Narrowing further with "giving critique" winnows it down to
this:<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=giving+critique">https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=giving+cri...</a><br>

<br>
Apart from pointing out basic errors such as spelling, grammar,
typos, confusing syntax, word echoes, or floating antecedents,
which should be utterly routine and feeling-free, framing remarks
in the mode of, "This bit did this for me. Did you really mean it
to work that way?" can be helpful. Saying "you are wrong" can be
argued with; saying "I had this response" really can't. Including
positive remarks along with the negative also helps keep the
recipient's ears open and less defensive.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I have a very tiny circle of other writers with whom
I exchange crit, all of us going back for years. Tact is still
required, but we all know that for all of us, making the work as
good as it can be comes before feelings. Though, granted, possibly
not by much; I still sometimes have to take a day or three to
digest negative crit sent my way. (It probably also helps that they
all write at a high professional level already, which cuts out need
for the bulk of lower-level -- but also more objective --
corrections.)<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, apart
from the prior tetralogy, and the picture in my head that wouldn't
go away that always started with Barr shaving off his Luthlian
beard and going on to find the burned-down farm, there was a
certain amount of reverse-inspiration from every YA novel
<i>ever</i> about the adolescent girl/young person running away
from a home where no one appreciates them, with or without the
village slaughtered in their wake, and onward with magical pet to
find secret powers, better mentors, improved bio-social status,
heroism in the War to Save the World, etc etc.<br>
<br>
This novella runs the classic scenario through more realistic
filters, and most of all looks to see what happens when one
switches the viewpoint and focus to the cast of characters who are
more normally portrayed as casually dismissed collateral damage or
public utilities. Thus, an exploration of the hazards of parenting,
of the people who have to carry the can, rather than of adolescent
empowerment.<br>
<br>
Lots of other details from my life and experience and acquaintance,
at all ages, went in as needed, but that's the structural
backbone.<br>
<br>
(There are a curiously large number of YA-centered stories out
there, both pro and fan, that seem to have absolutely <i>no
idea</i> what grownups do all day, nor how the worlds they live in
are made and maintained.)<br>

Vorkosigan books are available as ebooks on Kindle, Nook, and
iTunes. Speaking for Kindle, which I use myself, simply download
the free Kindle app from the Amazon website onto your chosen
device, and follow the directions. You should be up and reading in
minutes. It should work fine on your smartphone. (I also have the
app on my phone, as backup, though I don't use it for reading due
to small-size issues.) I believe our other two vendor platforms
offer something analogous.<br>
<br>
I have a Kindle Paperwhite, but I haven't used it since I put the
Kindle app on my general-purpose tablet, with its much larger
screen (which will also display e-manga and color.) It turns every
ebook into an instant large-print book, much appreciated by my
aging eyes. (I have an Android Pixel C, but most any tablet should
work the same)<br>
<br>
The Baen e-bookstore also offers some of my stuff, possibly in more
forms; check it out at Baen.com<br>

wrest back control of your auto-correct feature, which is stabbing
you in the back.<br>
<br>
I am not a writing teacher -- also, characterization is not a
conscious process for me, which makes it hard to break down into
teachable bits -- but I promise you will find much to chew on at
Pat Wrede's writing blog at <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/">http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/</a> You
can use its search function to winnow the offerings, for example by
typing "characterization" or other likely keywords into the search
box at the top.<br>
<br>
I see she also has her excellent Worldbuilding piece up, now
divided into subsections: <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.pcwrede.com/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/">https://www.pcwrede.com/fantasy-world...</a>
It focuses on fantasy, but much is equally applicable to SF.<br>
<br>
And, of course, there is her blog collection <i>Wrede on
Writing</i>, available as a separate ebook, very convenient.<br>

you ever randomly see someone who seems to perfectly resemble the
way you imagined one of your characters? I've had an experience
like that recently, from a couple of books (one of them yours) and
spent half a day trying to figure out where I knew them from before
it dawned on me. I felt nearly foolish for almost approaching them
to ask. Good thing I didn't..</a></div>

No, can't say as I've ever had that experience. I have physically
modeled characters from time to time off actors, at least for their
jumping-off points, but they tend to mutate into their unique
selves pretty quickly as the story goes on.<br>

First of all, learn the difference in definition and spelling
between "inspiring" and "aspiring", which I believe was the word
you were actually reaching for here. (Unless you were betrayed by
your auto-correct, in which case brush up on your
proofreading.)<br>

In order: we don't know, not known but not outside the range of
possibility, no, and no.<br>

The gods have no interest in human politics; they are only
interested in souls. They don't "fight" each other, but it is not
impossible they might compete for souls in subtler ways.<br>

Yes. Subterranean Press will be doing a collectable hardcover
edition like the Penric tales. Projected publication late July.
I've just had a look at the cover art by Jenn Ravenna, very nice,
so things are in train. Nice interior design, too.<br>
<br>
While it is on the shorter end of the novella range in word count,
about 23k words, paper publishing economics are the same and so
will the price be, $25. It's also a binding that will stand up to
library use. (If what you want is a cheap reading copy, you need to
turn to the e-edition.)<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(The current official length of a novella for SFWA or Hugo purposes
is defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 or 45,000
words, depending. This may change in future; not my problem,
though. The term's wider definition out in the world of all books
is looser.)</span></div>

You do realize I wrote that book almost 20 years ago...? :-)<br>
<br>
I just went and looked up that passage. The warning is simply one
Caz scarcely needs, that they are in a public and not necessarily
friendly venue, on-stage under all eyes in one of the biggest
political scenes so far of Iselle's young life, and he needs to be
formal and cautious in his speech.<br>

Interesting take.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, what any reader will get out of a work is
sensitively dependent on what they bring to it, since beyond the
words-in-a-row blueprint the writer supplies to all identically,
the construction materials are sourced locally.<br>
<br>
A worked example of the process may be had by anyone comparing the
high and low star rating reviews on any of my works, which Amazon
will handily collate for one. Anyone contemplating the range who
thinks, "It doesn't sound as if they read the same book," is quite
right; or, more precisely, didn't <i>experience</i> the same
book.<br>

I think these process questions may have been answered at greater
length earlier in this column -- people who want more are invited
to scroll back. But, briefly, the answer would be different for
each book but converging on "a little". My notions at the start
about the end change along the route as I write my way, scene by
scene, into my material, and new possibilities arise that were not
yet thought-of, and could not be thought-of, back at Scene 1. So
even when I think I know the ending, I often turn out to be wrong.
The story only looks inevitable in retrospect.<br>
<br>
My scene-by-scene outlines are a rolling process, scaffolding for
my elusive thinking and my prose, built and taken down in a
just-in-time fashion. Like nailing jello to the wall. (Which would
work, come to think, if you made the jello cold and concentrated
enough...)<br>

unfair to ask since your books don't fall into this category, but
what makes an author abandon a series that has an unfinished
through-line? I now have 4 different series I have followed where
the author seems to have abandoned them and moved on to other
things without wrapping up the larger story. (Example: 18 months
between each of the first 14 books. 5 years since the last one, a
semi-cliffhanger.)</a></div>

number of different answers. A series may cease to sell well enough
or be dropped by its publisher, in which case the writer may switch
to something that seems more salable. Editors jump houses or
companies go under, pulling out the support rug. The writer may
have health or family issues. The writer may lose interest, in
which case squeezing out more would be a sort of mental torture.
The writer may have run out of fresh things to say about this
particular set of characters or world, and be unwilling or unable
to recycle and repeat. Where the story seems to want to go may be a
place the writer doesn't wish to follow. The writer may have grown
into other interests, so the story doesn't have any powering
emotional resonance for them anymore. The zeitgeist may have moved
on, leaving the story beached, out of date, too clearly the product
of an earlier time. Or any combination of the
foregoing.</span></div>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Back in the day
(mid-80s) there was no internet nor, from a small town in Ohio,
other easily accessible source of information on agents, so I
mainly asked my writer friends, when we corresponded or I met them
at conventions, about theirs. My first such query sourced that way
fell flat, politely rejected. I no longer remember the details, but
I must have learned about the second through another writer
acquaintance who used that agent. (I had at that point made my
first novel sales to Baen unagented, and sold a scant few short
stories.) There was some no-longer-remembered exchange of letters,
but somehow we arranged to meet in NYC when I was there for the '89
Nebulas (at which <i>Falling Free</i> won for best novel) and shook
hands at a breakfast meeting the next day.<br>
<br>
Which was 30 years ago this spring, if I have my arithmetic right.
It was a very lucky break for me -- I had only the vaguest idea
what I was doing -- but, like most luck, preceded by a lot of
work.<br>

always has signed books of mine in stock, however, which may be
purchased in-store or mail order. Mail orders can sometimes be

Hugo's makes a great treasure trove to visit, and don't forget the

characters had some mild physical inspiration from actors over the
years, although once they hit the page they quickly mutated into
their unique selves. I haven't really been watching enough
live-action media lately to keep up on the more recent menu of
possibilities. I think my characters would want new actors and
actresses to bring them to life on-screen.<br>
<br>
That said, back in the day Aral had some somatic inspiration from
Oliver Reed, Cordelia from Vanessa Redgrave, Galeni from Paul
Darrow. I once saw a fellow in the early 80s who starred in a
BBC-TV production of <i>Richard III</i> that I thought could almost
do Miles, but his name escapes me... ah, thank you Internet, it was

To put it briefly: ideas are easy, writing is hard. Most writers
want to work on their own ideas, not someone else's.<br>
<br>
If you want to see <i>your</i> ideas on a page, you are far better
off learning how to write yourself. (Among other things, that
should teach you why your hopeful plan above won't work.)<br>

any backlogs of text that did not make it to the published work
that you deem readable by your fans? Or that you regret leaving
out?</a></div>

I have very little in the way of scene-sized outtakes, because most
of that editing happens at the rolling-outline stage, and doesn't
make it past pencil-scratchings. When I was slogging through the
middle of what became <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, I did write an
experimental prologue from Guppy's point of view, but decided the
book was thematically better served starting where it had. Which is
around somewhere... ah.<br>

Wow, that was a while back. (Spoilery if you've not read the book,
btw.)<br>
<br>
There were also iirc five chapters midway in Ivan's book that went
in a different direction and ground to a dead halt, which I
scrapped in favor of the final and better developments. (I was
basically trying to shove Ivan into a Miles-like plot, which did
not work either logically or psychologically.) That was probably my
biggest post-composition cut. It's nothing I'd show or can even
readily find at this point, but it wasn't altogether work wasted,
as I made up a deal of material, including a first pass on Moira
ghem Estif, that I recycled in various ways.<br>
<br>
So, nothing to show and no regrets.<br>
<br>

was wondering if you had any characters, items, places, dialogues,

for a story idea that had? My idea is about an island where story
pieces that are thrown out, given up on or abandoned end up. I've
been asking authors if they have anything I could use because I
want to put some truth in the idea. It's totally fine if you don't
have anything. Thanks!</a></div>

Sorry, I don't have anything for you.<br>
<br>
Upon reflection, I realize that everything I've started, I've
finished. This is more parsimony than anything else, I suspect.<br>

You can make up your own story fragments, you know. Which will be

Probably the Vorkosiverse. Pre-industrial-world medical care and
life options are pretty dire, not to mention their more limited
access to information.<br>

I suspect this is one of those recent spate of spam questions, but
just in case it's not, my birth year is listed on my author
profile.<br>
<br>
L.<br>
<br>
(The spam questions have been weird. Some are outright gibberish,
some <i>could</i> be an ESL person struggling to express himself,
none have anything specific to do with my works (something of a
tip-off.) They don't usually seem to embed advertising links,
though some are clearly attempted mass promotion of newbie amateur
ebooks entirely unrelated to my genres. Anyone else have thoughts
on how to deal with this clutter?<br>
<br>
There are also a sprinkling of gibberish comments that turn up
randomly under my book reviews. Are other reviewers getting
these?)<br>

I have the power to skip or flag peculiar Q&amp;A entries. I should
likely skip more of them, but years of ingraining from public
schools -- answer every question you can on the test! -- is hard to
overcome.<br>
<br>
I do have to approve "friends", but as this is a public site for,
well, publicity, I don't vet them. (For one thing, that would be
much too large a tax on my time and attention.)<br>

Nothing at present. Well, except my own, to check galleys on
reprints, but that's not done for <i>fun</i>. I do try to drop
brief reviews of whatever I am reading that I finish here in my "My

I am most certainly not one of the first to write romance into SF
-- E. E. "Doc" Smith and Anne McCaffrey preceded me by decades,
among many, <i>many</i> others.<br>
<br>
SFR (Science Fiction Romance, for the uninitiated) has hived off
subsequently into its own commercially viable subgrenre, and I
haven't been keeping up with its developments.<br>
<br>
I'm enough of an old SF hand that I feel that if one is going to
make a romance central to an SF story, the new technology, science,
and/or world-building should <i>make a difference</i> to how the
old reproductive dance plays out. Not just drop a bog-standard
romance down in front of an SFnal backdrop. But people write and
read this stuff for many more varied reasons than I do, so that's
more an observation of my own tastes than a god-forbid prescription
to anyone else.<br>

was why he questioned the "marked clear" designation. Until the

Simon questioned it because Simon questions everything; he's a
naturally suspicious fellow. (Well, also by training and long
experience. Rats, he smells them. At a great distance.) That
ImpSec's records didn't match the facts-as-found could only be
determined later; finding out <i>why</i> they didn't match will
certainly be someone's job post-events.<br>

McMaster Bujold, First of all, in my household, my father regarded
you as the best that SciFi had to offer and it was stories of Miles
retold to me as an asthmatic child in the ER, for the umpteenth
time impatiently breathing away through a nebuliser cursing myself
and my asthma for millionth time, that place you upon so high a
pedestal. Was Dubauer based upon a real life person?</a></div>

Pre-nerve-disruptor Dubauer wasn't based on anyone in particular;
though he barely had stage time to develop before unfortunate plot
events happened to him. His behavior post-damage during the trek
was inspired and informed by my experiences chasing one-year-old
toddlers. It's an age when they are just getting into that
suicidal-mania stage, pre-verbal and post-mobile, lasting the next
couple of years that gives so many parents heart attacks.<br>
<br>
Which also gave Aral and Cordelia a chance to subconsciously scope
each other out as prospective parents.<br>

I'm glad my work served you!<br>

Yes, it was a metaphor. (Or else the email would be much more
exciting to open, but I don't think even Vorkosiverse technology is
up to emailing live animals. Though that suggests a very different
SF story...) Ivan is performing a typical secretarial or executive
assistant's task of triaging the day's incoming demands and
filtering out things his boss shouldn't waste his limited time
upon.<br>

consider himself straight. So is 10/12ths of Desdemona. (Or
8/10ths, if one declines to speculate on the gender identities of
the lioness and the mare.)<br>
<br>
Balancing these competing views is one of Pen's many tasks in
accommodating his demon.<br>
<br>
Also playing in is Pen's deep medical education and experience.
When one of your jobs is teaching anatomy to medical students
through human and other dissection (a winter course, back in
Martensbridge), you pretty much get over any kind of
body-consciousness. Between the long medical careers of Amberein
and Helvia, and his own shorter but extremely intense one, Pen has
pretty much seen it all by age 29, and must sometimes remind
himself that other people are shyer or more prudish. "Anyone with
their skin still on looks dressed to me," as I believe he phrased
it once.<br>

Nope.<br>
<br>
Most of Freud has been rendered obsolete by advances in
neurobiology, which is, y'know, actual science.<br>
<br>
This, btw, is a typical spam-looking question. The two tip-offs are
that there is nothing whatsoever in it about my work or me, and
that the questioner is a <i>tabula rasa</i>. Should I just be

valid reason for asking. It was and IS my life experience, that
made me agree with your answer. Now how did analyze the blank

When a query looks a bit odd, a check of the poster's page shows
their stats. If they have more books than friends, I figure they
are here on GR for the right reasons. Granted that's not a good
proxy when a person has just joined.<br>
<br>
I don't auger down any more than that, because I am not here to vet
people. Or be responsible for them in any other way, by preference.
(I have to overcome <i>decades</i> of parental and placation
reflexes for that, a work in progress.)<br>

Freud seems to be the psychology equivalent of the phlogiston
theory: seemed logical in its day, spawned lingering metaphors,
obsoleted by further data.<br>

Lois! Tried to the best of my ability to search through the 724

are my thanks for your work (I am hard pressed to add an adjective
here, "extraordinary", "life-changing" or "life-saving" all not
quite what I mean) and my question: did you choose Grover Gardner

just saw that the Sharing Knife universe is not, as I had always
assumed, a (very) post-apocalyptic descendant of our own. Certain
cultural details, like the birthday cake (complete with candles) as
well a the plants and animals made it feel like it was closely
related to our Earth. Do you see it as an alternative history
version of Earth, and if so, when did the timelines split? Or has
it always been its own place?</a></div>

The Sharing Knife (or the Wide Green World) has always been its own
world, not descended from our own.<br>
<br>
It is, however, a source-riff on Midwestern US in parallel, or
contrast, to the many, many cod-Europe fantasies out there. If
Tolkien can do it with England, and Pratchett with The Chalk, I
don't see why my home should be excluded from the game. (Aragorn

This is too complex and individual a question to be answered in a
paragraph (or possibly at all), so commenters are invited to chime
in below.<br>
<br>
But briefly, for myself as a reader, the writer/artist can sell me
almost any kind of world-building if they have convinced me of the
reality of the characters, and get me inside their heads for some
sort of gripping interiority. (Granted, my foray into manga and
anime has lowered the bar for world-building logic.)<br>
<br>
As a <i>writer</i>, while I know readers will forgive or overlook
much in a work that just delivers up the right emotional
set-pieces, I don't want them to have to. (If a work doesn't
deliver up the emotions, there is little point in reading it; one
would be better off spending the same time reading non-fiction. Not
that non-fiction isn't selected and edited to be a kind of fiction
in its own right.) So the attention I spend on world-building is
actually in support of my characters.<br>

I do not own or operate dendarii.com; Michael Bernardi does. He's
here on Goodreads, so you should be able to find him for questions
about the site. Note that he maintains it solely as a fannish labor
of love, unpaid.<br>
<br>
Softwear Toys 'n Tees was owned by a fan out of somewhere near
Chicago, Steve Salaba, and again, I don't own or operate it, or
know if he's still in business. You'll have to search, I guess.
There was another convention dealer doing stuff for a while,
Pegasus iirc, but I haven't heard from them in years.<br>

I suppose a dead snake would be some problem that should have been
dealt with below this level, a garden snake would be ordinary Ops
issues, and a venomous snake would be something with hidden
political implications or connections, or some genuine
time-critical emergency. (Actually, the later would bypass the
herpetology triage altogether.)<br>

Er, I am not Paul de Becker, and in fact have no idea who he may
be. Though that's the person you'd need to ask for certain
permission. It does sound like academic fair use to me, but other

What you are talking about is a horror novella, of which there are
many, classic and new. Most of the older classics (which I expect
your teacher would prefer) are probably available free on-line.
Perhaps other readers could chime in with some of their faves

Nope, that's a throw-away line, on the order of the politician, the
lighthouse, and the trained cormorant. (A classic example from the
Sherlock Holmes stories.) Not every Dendarii assignment/escapade

and starting the count in late 1982, I wrote 3 novels in 3 years,
sold them all to Baen in late 1985, and tried to produce a book a
year thereafter. Lather, rinse, repeat for thirty years, and here I
am. Submitting my 4th novel <i>Falling Free</i> to <i>Analog</i>

winning my first Nebula with it.<br>

I don't think I've talked about this much, as it is a story element
I had no desire to commit to one way or another. (Although if there
is anything, it would be in interviews from around when the books
were first published -- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"

"https://vorkosigan.fandom.com/wiki/Author_Interviews">https://vorkosigan.fandom.com/wiki/Au...</a>
) Gods might have been real, and left or were excluded; gods might
have always been as mythological as our own. The two things
certainly known is that some people have an extrasensory perception
and magical manipulative abilities, and no one believes the gods
are around now. There should be folk stories about this, but I did
not have occasion in the books to recount (invent) any.<br>

Yes, the landscapes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i> are indeed drawn
from my Ohio childhood (now mostly paved.) I don't offhand know the
building, though. There's a lot of so-called Brutalist (if I'm
getting the name right) architecture around, though, as 20th C.
architects did regrettable things with concrete.<br>

I use real places much the way working artists use reference photos
when arranging their compositions; not because I am trying to draw
a portrait, but as a quick way to get proportions and perspectives
right for a coming overlay pursuing quite another purpose.<br>
<br>
Readers who try to read the result as portraiture -- either as
historical fiction with the serial numbers filed off, or as
historical critique -- are using inappropriate viewing protocols
for this style of composition. The ones who attempt to draw
mistakenly exact one-to-one correspondences between such fiction
and history, and then try to tell the writer they got it wrong,
are... unstoppable, apparently.<br>
<br>
Not accusing you of this, btw. But it does come up, if one makes
the mistake of revealing how sausages are made.<br>

I don't have news re: an audio edition yet, though it will
certainly be offered. I am pleased to report Subterranean Press has
offered for a limited hardcover like the others, though. They still
have to chew through "The Flowers of Vashnoi" and "Knife Children"
first, though, so that will likely be about a year.<br>

I hope my question isn't offensive. But I was talking to another
person who also read your books (I don't think she counts as a
fan), and she complained that Miles thought about sex too much --
she was referring to the Borders of Infinity scene, I think. Do you

about it, since they supposedly think about it every few

While I doubt that the "every few seconds" factoid is correct --
men vary about sex quite as much as women do, if not necessarily in
the same proportions (and over time as well as by individuals) -- I
do think expecting book-characters to be comfortably asexual, or at
least anything about their sexual lives well-hidden off-stage, is
less likely to be found in modern writing than in the older, more
censored sort that she might prefer.<br>
<br>
As for how authentically guy-like Miles is, guy readers will have
to speak to that.<br>

Lois, my wife and I were listening to A Civil Campaign again and
just wanted to thank you (and Grover) for giving us an additional
family to care about for these 2+ decades. In the mid-90's I mailed
my collection of Miles books to my not-yet wife to cheer her up and
within a year, we were married. She says introducing her to the
VorKosigan's sealed the deal. Thanks so very much. Sorry this isn't

Q&amp;A function is in dire need of a search function. I don't
think whoever set it up imagined answered questions over time
running into the many hundreds. When they started out, the reader
could not even order questions by newest-first, but was just
presented with a random mix. Maybe if many, many people requested a
Q&amp;A search function of the GR site wranglers, one might be
installed?<br>
<br>
To answer your question, Miles was at that moment having his
epiphany about his true identity through that metaphor of his
Barrayaran stubborness refusing to give up his underlying identity
as a Barrayaran and a Vorkosigan, despite how Naismith's glittering
galactic possibilities tried to seduce him. Not just the echo of
his ancestors' war-tenacity, but an echo of his future
responsibilities to his District and redeeming the poisoned
land.<br>

finished Orphans of Raspay. Thank you as always. But it sparked an
odd thought. It seems like Penric's life is going to overlap that
of the Golden General and Fonsa, far away though they may be. Like
when I realized that if Julius Cesar died in 44 BC, there must have
been people alive at the same time as both he and Jesus, a few
could even conceivably have met both of them (Magi). Odd,
yes?</a></div>

the Peninsula to the east or the west of the map in Orphans? As I
look at the island chain, it looks as if it should be to the west,
but as I read the book and look at the maps on the site, I feel as
if it is to the east. Again, thanks. I just like to be
oriented!</a></div>

Remember, north is toward the equator, south is toward the nearest

to the east and the Cedonian to the west.<br>

be two 3-novella collections upcoming next year from Baen. The
first, due out in January in hardcover, will be titled "Penric's
Progress". The second, slated for later in the year, will be titled
"Penric's Travels". I'll be making a proper blog post about them
later on, when this rather busy summer's other publishing
activities have been worked through.<br>

Trade and/or mass market paperback editions will presumably follow
from Baen after the usual intervals.<br>

that the first article of the Betan constitution is "access to
information shall not be abridged", how do the Betans always manage
to stay one step ahead in R&amp;D, especially in weapons systems?
Is it just that Betan engineers and scientists are so far ahead in
competence and understanding that the rest of the galaxy has to
scramble to keep up?</a></div>

The social aspects of religion, how humans use religion to organize
themselves to carry out various social functions, are pulled from a
lifetime of observation and reading; the mystical likewise from
readings across several real-world religions. The underlying
theo... call it theography, I made up myself, and is very contrary
to most real-world religions.<br>
<br>
The gods of Chalion are not, and are generally understood not to be
creator-gods, but evolved and evolving from matter that came first.
They are not deities people can give bribes to in the form of
sacrifices for material-world favors, or to punish people one does
not like either before or after death, both early motivations for
religious beliefs. (Although I'm sure some people, being people,
try anyway.) They are however about a non-material afterlife,
although not one that is easy to understand or describe. "Union
with god" is meant rather literally, here.<br>

One of my notions for these e-novellas was that they should be ala
carte, open-ended, not bolted to any particular series template. So
I don't exactly have plans, more like possibilities. Penric has
that invaluable character trait of being good for several different
kinds of tales, so I shouldn't have to repeat myself any time soon.
(Although one of the interesting things an writer can do in a
series is revisit themes for a different slice on them, which I
don't rule out.)<br>

apparently unpublished cover titled Barrayar, by Mark Salwoski.
According to him "the artwork was done in the UK in the early
90’s". I wonder if this painting could have been for another of
your books. It doesn't really fit "Barrayar" and would be more
appropriate for "The Warrior's Apprentice" or "The VorGame". Had
you seen it ?<br>

I don't teach writing, not even over the internet. A good source
for level-headed writing tips is <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/">http://www.pcwrede.com/blog/</a> or
Pat's ebook <i>Wrede on Writing</i>. Here is a quick link to a
dozen of her posts on just that topic: <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=endings">https://www.pcwrede.com/?s=endings</a><br>

<br>
That said, a lot more attention in writing advice seems to be
devoted to beginnings. My own stubborn tendency to finish almost
everything I start has resulted in me writing almost as many
endings as beginnings, so the practice effect has had a chance to
cut in.<br>
<br>
Your question as written also brings up the question, "Ending to
what?", since each story's needs in that department will be a
little or a lot different from every other, depending on what has
gone before. See: Pat's links.<br>

global to be dubbed a "technique", since I don't think it's
detachable from my whole writing process. For the viewpoint
characters, it certainly involves mentally walking into their skins
and bones, wrapping their lives and worlds around me, and looking
out through their eyes as best as I can. For the
non-viewpoint-characters, I suppose it has something to do with
recognizing each is an independent actor in their own life, a kind
of lite version of the foregoing. A form of virtual literary method
acting, perhaps.<br>

Pat, as always, has more wide-ranging things to say. <a target=

Nope. The first I usually hear is when it pops up on the
downpour.com website. (It's not there yet as of 9/8/19.) I would
expect a minimum production time of 4 months from the time we
signed the contract (August), maybe six, so... midwinter...?<br>

"/questions/1659394-lois-i-noticed-in-reading">Lois, I noticed in
reading Chalion/Paladins that out of all modern fantasy 'greats',
your writing in the medieval 'idiom' is the most authentic in terms
of colloquialism / style of language / manner of speaking, syntax,
turns of phrase. Many authors write very 'modern' medieval prose.
How/where do you learn this authentic manner of accurate
syntax/dialogue/prose? Reading a lot of historical fiction, or?
Thanks!</a></div>

historical reading, certainly. But Shakespeare, mainly, I think. I
used to belong to a play-reading group back in the 90s, and we went
through a lot of his plays. The cadences worm into your brain.<br>
<br>
I also pay attention to what turns of phrase or metaphors don't
belong, perhaps because that technology or theory does not exist in
the world of my tale. Though the <i>absence</i> of some literary
toe-stub tends not to be noticed. I can't be too strict about it,
though, because so many words have become common coin. The 5GU or
the world of the Sharing Knife never had the theory of the four
humours, for example, but "sanguine" or "melancholy" are still
useful words.<br>

That's a question you'd have to ask Blackstone Audiobooks. I
wouldn't think so, however, since they already have a working
edition. About the only time one gets new narrators is if one
switches publishers, not in my plans. Blackstone has been pretty
good to me for quite a while.<br>

So the question is probably harder to answer than you'd think.<br>
<br>
Among the early Baen covers, the original cover for <i>Memory</i>
stood out, possibly because I'm partial to blue. <i>Paladin of
Souls</i> was perhaps the best from HarperCollins. The upcoming one
for the Subterranean edition of "Knife Children", which no one has
yet seen, is an unusually fine character portrayal. The Japanese
covers have their own style, well worth taking a look at. And so
on; see links above.<br>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>This is an
interesting problem that is part of the technological changes of
our times. In the old paper-only world, book sales to libraries
were self-limiting -- after a certain amount of use, books wore
out, and needed to be replaced or discarded. They were not
available in unlimited quantities free forever to compete with
actual book sales, upon which not only publishers but authors
live.<br>
<br>
Attempts to fit ebooks into this old economic model have been
awkward. One mode is to limit the number of checkouts per purchase
to something approximating the average life of a paper book.
Another, mentioned in the article, is to up the price to the
libraries to partially compensate. One I would actually favor,
which I understand is used in some other countries, is to charge
the library some small sum per checkout. Overhauling the multitude
of scattered and independent library systems to e-report same to
the multitude of publishing entities is obviously do-able, but
difficult; some central money clearing-house might need to be
devised (and paid for, siphoning off yet more between
reader/purchaser and author, sigh.) Amazon manages somehow, but
they have a better budget and are under a single roof.<br>
<br>
I am, increasingly, an ebook <i>user</i> from my local library, as
my eyes don't play well with print on paper anymore. (My tablet
turns every ebook into an instant large-print book.) So I find
myself on both sides of the debate, wanting more to be available to
me as a reader, and wanting to actually be, y'know, <i>paid</i> for
my work as a writer. The current system, or rather, mess of
competing systems, isn't really satisfactory for anyone.<br>

'communityAnswererName'><a href=
"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>The answer
varies with the type of book and publisher and the terms of the
individual contracts. Typically, the author will be due royalties,
i.e., a percent of the cover price of each book sold retail, in the
neighborhood of anything from 2% (in the more abusive practices of
some romance and academic publishers) to 6-8-10% per paperback
sale, to 15% for hardcovers after a certain sales break-point. You
can do the arithmetic, but that translates to a range between $.48
for an $8 paperback to $3.75 for a $25 hardcover of the purchaser's
money going to the author. (As one can see, a writer needs to sell
a <i>pile</i> of paperbacks to make a living.)<br>
<br>
(As a side note, the rest does not all go to the publishers, who
sell books to vendors at discounts of up to 50%. The difference
between wholesale and retail is what the bookstores live on. The
waste in the system would take a whole 'nother essay, but look up
"remainders.")<br>
<br>
An advance is money paid up front to the writer as a debt against
future royalties. The author's share when the book is finally put
on sale goes first to paying back the advance, at which point the
book is said to have "earned out" and twice-yearly-accounted
royalties start flowing to the writer. There is a lot of mythology
surrounding the size of advances, but I think of it as money earned
by my future self being paid to my current self. The publishers
assume some risk in this regard, since they have to eat the
difference if the advance does not earn out -- it is
non-returnable.<br>
<br>
Ebooks are even more wildly varied. It is important to note that
entities such as iBooks, Amazon, and B&amp;N are <i>vendors</i>,
not publishers. Per unit sale, Amazon ferex keeps 30% of sales
priced over a certain break point -- I don't remember offhand if it
was $1.99 or $2.99 -- passing 70% through to the author or
publisher, and keeps 65% for sales under the break point, passing
35% through to the originator. They pay monthly. If a book is indie
published, this goes directly to the writer, after an initial
3-month delay.<br>
<br>
If an ebook is published through one's paper publisher, the
publisher passes 25% - 50% of their e-receipts through to the
author as royalty, so the author gets 50% of 70% = 35% of each
ebook sale, accounted quarterly or half-yearly. The publisher
potentially does a hella lot of work for the writer and their book
to earn this, so most writers I know regard the 50% split as
fair.<br>
<br>
Terms for ebooks sold directly through publishers' websites or
other venues will vary with the publisher.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(The other crucial factor for non-indie writers that has changed
with the arrival of ebooks is contractual term-of-license, but
that, too, would take another essay.)<br>

to write and finish a good book.<br>

Next, in this day of the internet, go to the publisher's website

time.<br>

There are lots of writers' groups and other help online these days.
I can't say much about them because I am not plugged into them
myself; commenters below may have some more current tips. But a
good place to start for level-headed advice is <a target="_blank"

Begin at the beginning, read all the posts, and then, if any
question is still unanswered, you can float it. (Do read first, so
you won't be asking a question that's been answered eight times
already.)<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>I started
boringly, waiting to be taught how to read in first grade. About
second grade, I discovered I was allowed to read <i>any</i> book in
the school library, not just the thin picture books laid out for my
class during library period, and my reading level shot up.<br>
<br>
The number of books I read in a year has varied wildly over the
course of my life; lots back in my school days and my early working
years, less once kids and my career arrived. Lately my reading time
is limited by annoying eye issues, hence my recent turn to manga,
ebooks, anime, and Great Courses DVDs. You can see the YA and manga
I've reviewed (which is not all I've read, nor the anime I've
consumed) on my My Books section -- <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7672661">https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...</a><br>

<br>
I'm not sure what your reading level is in English, nor what kind
of access you have to them where you are, though if you have access
to Amazon, it's lots. Readers in the comments section might chime
in with their favorite YA. (Probably not the depressing ones, if
the OP is trying to boot up a desire to read more.) Patricia C.
Wrede's books are marketed as YA, and are a lot of fun. You might
try her 4-book series <i>The Enchanted Forest Chronicles</i>. T.
Kingfisher (who writes kids' books as Ursula Vernon) is also
fun.<br>
<br>
I don't think I have <i>a</i> favorite book -- it's varied over the
years. Much-reread books/authors in the past have included Tolkien
and Georgette Heyer, though I'm mainly moving on to other
explorations now.<br>

"Decide" makes it sound like a more conscious process than it is.
Imaginative streams of daydreams of bits about any or all of the
characters can run through my head, if my head is in that mode.
(Most of which aren't useful or consistent, cutting-room floor
stuff.) One set may have more psychological resonance for me, will
be more <i>interesting</i>. I'll start to think more about it, and
an accretion of thoughts may eventually hit some critical mass that
would promise to support an actual writable story. I may start
making penciled notes at that stage, but at least half of those few
also get discarded in favor of something I eventually like
better.<br>

seen the film "Russian Ark"? It's a 90 minute long film that was
shot in a single take. The camera wanders the halls of the
Hermitage while encountering the ghosts of Catherine II and the
Romanov girls. It finishes up with a re-creation of the last
Russian state ball before the declaration of WWI. That major scene
included thousands of extras. It made a great stand-in for
Barrayar. Happy natal day!</a></div>

The synopsis on the vendor pages is accurate, because I wrote it
myself. Ferex <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=

Nook.<br>
<br>
I can't tell if you would like it, because every reader is
different, but I can say the hero in this novella is a grownup,
with grownup-level problems, which include looking out for other
people.<br>
<br>
It's fine to start here -- the story stands alone -- although there
is a beginning to the arc, featuring a younger Penric, "Penric's
Demon", that tells how his string of adventures first got
started.<br>

If you do read it/them, do report back and tell us how/if you
enjoyed them.<br>

Staying home! No commute.<br>
<br>
After that, the autonomy, though allowing that one must do things
like make deadlines. Or turn in the final work before one runs out
of money, whichever happens first.<br>
<br>
It also gives me an excuse to be interested in everything or
anything, most writers having magpie minds.<br>
<br>
It also brings one interesting friends and colleagues. Also, a
manageable amount of attention, always gratifying. (Well, when it's
positive.)<br>

publishers charge libraries crazy amounts for their ebooks? The

Authors are in it for the money, too, or else they have to stop
writing and get another job. Or become destitute in their old age,
not uncommon, or medically destitute at any time. (Not me -- I've
planned ahead, and also been very, very lucky.)<br>
<br>
The thing about e-books is that they don't wear out, so placing one
in a library without restrictions is tantamount to giving it away
for free forever. The money has to come from somewhere, or everyone
goes out of business. In the US, libraries are supported by
property taxes in their respective communities, and you know how
much everyone loves to pay taxes.<br>
<br>
I personally would be in favor of a charge-per-e-checkout model,
but the complexities of getting such in place are large, especially
in the US with its diverse and independent libraries and
publishers.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(If you do the arithmetic in your example, $55 barely replaces 4
lost e-book sales. A popular title may have dozens or even hundreds
of checkouts. How does this compare with libraries buying 4 paper
copies of a hot title, and then discarding 3 of them when the
demand wears off or the books wear out? These problems are more
complex than they appear at first glance.)</span></div>

what is it about the midwest region like Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc.
that produces so many of the top writers (serious, non quipy
question)? From you, to Rothfuss(Wisconsin), Scott
Lynch(Minnesota), Brent Weeks(Montana), NK Jemison(Iowa), Brandon
Sanderson (Nebraska), etc. But in particular Minnesota/Wisconsin

you add in all the ones who originated in the (broader) Midwest and
moved elsewhere -- Poul Anderson, Heinlein, and Harlan Ellison, to
name 3 off the top of my head -- it's been going on for a while.
Not to mention Gordy Dickson or Clifford Simak, who stayed.<br>
<br>
Someone (not me) would have to do an actual regional count of SF
writers, calibrate for population density, and compare, to discover
if this is an actual thing, or just an effect of expectations of a
low density being surprised by an average one.<br>
<br>
That said, there were and are a synergistic groups of writers in
the Twin Cities in several genres who stimulate each other, but,
again, you'd have to compare us with other cities of similar size
to see what's really going on.<br>

from the Midwest.)<br>

"Great" is a reader's judgment of their reading experience, which
is different for every reader-book combination. So even if you just
limited your survey to people who liked my books, the array of
reasons and reactions are bewilderingly varied, as any cruise
through my reader reviews here on GR or Amazon will show. (Plus
some people who had a great reading may not be articulate about why
-- commercial fiction read for pleasure does not normally come with
a quiz next period.) So that half of your question is the one the

<br>
It's among the most level-headed writing advice on the net.<br>
<br>
My own how-I-got-published experiences are now 35 years out of date
for the modern market, so mainly of historical interest. But the
very short version is that one learns how to write by actually
writing -- and then learning to self-edit. The latter, happily, is
more teachable.<br>

Thanks!<br>
<br>
It's a career honor, in essence. Which is kind of recursive, being
in some sense an award for winning awards, but there you go. I
think the equivalent on the fan-or-reader side is probably being
invited to be the Worldcon writer guest-of-honor. In any case, all
good.<br>

No, I don't think so. NESFA's original motive was to put in
hardcover the batch of my early works that had only appeared as
original paperbacks. The first eight titles, if I'm counting right.
After that Baen began issuing them as commercial hardcovers first,
so there was no need.<br>
<br>
Unified, complete series reprint editions are a small-demand market
(where small = microscopic), and with reason. I remain bemused that
the very first fan comment on my announcement of our (somewhat
experimental) print-on-demand edition of <i>The Spirit Ring</i> was
someone helpfully chiming in to tell the world that no one needed
to buy it, used copies could be had on-line for a fraction of the
price. Which is exactly why publishers are reluctant to do reprints
of backlist (old) books unless there is a hot new frontlist release
to boost interest. (Or a big media adaptation, I suppose.)<br>

I pronounce it with the hard g. Both of them.<br>
<br>
While I am on the subject, my last name is pronounced with a
French, not a Spanish J. I can always tell when someone is from the
Southwest when they try to pronounce it "Boo-hold". It's actually
"Boo-jhold". (I'm told my ex's family used to pronounce it
"Bee-jou", even more confusing.)<br>

Ms Bujold! I have been a huge fan of your work for some time,

wanted to congratulate you on your recent news, and ask if you find
it constricting to be constantly asked to provide yet another
Vorkosigan novel, despite your success with other story arcs in

Mm, not constricting. I've had decades of practice at resisting
other people's suggestions for what I should write. And at least it
shows they're <i>interested</i>.<br>

I notice my answers to that frequently asked question are getting

Re: publishers, you have to learn to read publisher-speak. What
they are really saying is that they want something that will
<i>sell</i> as well or better than whatever came before. Strict
series work is an economic security blanket for them. To be sure,
they presumably bought the earlier work because they liked it and
it seemed what they were looking for.<br>
<br>
Tor editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden had a classic rant from the
editor's side about "writers as otters" on the subject. Short
version: when you try to train an otter to do a trick, and reward
it hoping for a repeat, the otter doesn't think, "Great! She liked
it! I'll do it again!", but rather, "Great! She liked it! Now I'll
do something <i>else</i> that's <i>even cooler</i>!"<br>
<br>
(Turning in something that sells better, or copping a few major
awards, mutes this sort of thing to muffled editorial whimpers, but
one can't count on that.)<br>
<br>
My award-storage has moved around over the years. For a while I
kept my first Nebula on a shelf over my kitchen sink, so I could
enjoy it while washing dishes. (No dishwasher in that old kitchen.)
My old house had a fireplace with three little stone shelves that
stuck out, which held three Hugos very nicely for a while. My
current place has some built-in cabinet-shelves in the back of the
living room that houses everything now.<br>

about names in the World of the Five Gods: I live in Catalonia, and

Foix is a Catalan place name, pronounced Fosh, and also a
southern-French name, pronounced Fwa. You're not J. R. R. Tolkien,

Sort of. A quick-and-dirty method for making up a bunch of names
that sound as if they come from the same place/language is to take
a real-world map or other name-source, chop the place names into
syllables, and reassemble them in whatever ways seem pleasing. It
is well to have some slight awareness that such names may
themselves be the product of several languages layered in over
time. (As in the Iberian peninsula.) I often, when booting up ideas
for a tale, generate a page or two of possible names to do quick
picks from so that I don't get stalled for hours/days every time a
new person or place arrives on stage. I occasionally swap names
around, if I find I've made a non-optimum assignment, and want the
better, more fitting name to go with something that appears more
often.<br>
<br>
I (and Foix) pronounce his name to rhyme with toy.<br>
<br>
Other places on the map helped generate names in other regions of
the world of the five gods, some perhaps less obvious than others.
For the Weald, I tried to get as many names as possible in standard
English, to subliminally indicate that these people have been on
their ground for a long time, with less "Torpenhowe Hill" effect.
(Which, if you don't know it, is a place in England that
back-translates "Hillhillhill Hill".)<br>
<br>
The problems of coming up with short, pronounceable names, each
different enough visually from every other one used to be readily
distinguishable, that aren't accidentally an unfortunate word in
another language (or, indeed, one's own) are non-trivial.<br>

gravity is within maybe 5% of Earth's, Komarr's enough less to
notice. At least if one is Barrayaran.<br>

I would imagine most places with artificial gravity would set it
close to Earth-normal, for physiological reasons, but really,
anything is possible.<br>

No, I haven't worked out a table of astrographic data for every
throw-away line I ever generated. If conditions are enough
different from standard for a person to notice or to affect the

enough different, I suppose.)<br>

<br>
The 5GW has the Father's Day, on winter solstice, which marks the
official beginning of His quarter of the year. So it's a somewhat
more somber religious holiday than the American winter Saturnalia
honoring, as far as I can tell, Mammon.<br>
<br>
The Daughter's Day falls on the spring equinox, the Mother's on
summer solstice, the Son's on the autumn equinox, and the Bastard's
on whichever days are added to make the year come out even for the
shift of the seasons with respect to days versus planetary orbits.
Usually but not universally the white god's day/s are assigned to
Mother's Midsummer, at the halfway mark between summer solstice and
autumn equinox. Plenty of holidays for all!<br>

I'm a huge fan of your work, I'm finishing up Shards of Honor right

women is a major feature of this story. What's your opinion on how
to appropriately depict sexual assault in fiction given the
tendency (especially in fantasy/sci fi) for it to be romanticized?

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Well, keep in
mind that <i>Shards</i> was written in 1983, when the public
conversation around these issues was quite different. But in
general, I don't think violence against women should be portrayed
erotically. Given Rule 34, it really is impossible for a writer to
control how their prose is read, though it's at least possible to
control how it is written.<br>
<br>
My own views on the matter are more bio-evolutionary than social
(not that the latter isn't the costume the that former wears.)
Primate studies are most interesting to me, because they actually
provide a control group for comparison. In primates,
non-reproductive mounting (and reproductive, for that matter) a
very clearly expressions of bio-social dominance or would-be
dominance, a statement of "I am more important than you and this
proves it!" (Obviously especially urgent to someone who has
internal doubts about their status.) Extension to the highest
primates left as a mental exercise for the student.<br>
<br>
The deepest work I've ever read on these issues, which I recommend
to everyone, is Nick Lane's <i>Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria
and the Meaning of Life</i>. <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39001.Power_Sex_Suicide">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...</a>
It's 14 years old now, which is, like, 98 bioscience-years at the
current pace, but much of it covers fundamental aspects that have
been well-established and aren't likely to be changed.<br>

please forgive the riend request, was a slip of the thumb on my

again. I wonder though if you have been approached by any RPG
publishers who want to make the world into game? I know SJ Games
did GURPS Vorkosigan, and i hope that was mutually beneficial. W5G
is such a wonderful and rich place, i feel like it would be fun to
play in it.</a></div>

My agent prefers to hold those rights in hopes of some larger media

I am so not an expert on child-raising. I feel my own survived
despite not because of me, though it wasn't for lack of trying. Two
off-the-cuff thoughts are: appropriately applauding creative
efforts/attending when they are shown off, and giving the kid the
space to concentrate.<br>
<br>
And, of course, reading to them is always good, although on this
site that hardly seems needful to mention.<br>
<br>
Also, generational drift being what it is, as they get older their
notions of creative media and yours may not intersect as much as
you'd fondly pictured. I'm reminded of my mother, who used to
criticize my sitting around reading F&amp;SF books in my teens when
she thought I should be Doing Something -- preferably chores,
obviously, but I suspect also creative activities to which she
herself related, such as painting or fabric arts. The reading and
fantasizing were just too invisible.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Thank you! That is just the sort of more wide-ranging reportage
that this collection needs to get the word out.<br>
<br>
No, no foreign offers on Penric yet except Japan, who did a lovely
job on their cover last year.<br>

<br>
Now that the 3-story collection makes up actual novel-length market
weight, and with a second in the offing, I'm hoping for more action
on the translations front, but first, of course, foreign editors
need to hear of the works.<br>

Well, no two characters can or even should be alike, so I can't
promise you another Caz. If you haven't tried the Penric novellas
yet, they might work for you as well, if differently, as Penric
starts out as a much more callow youth, who is not even now as old
as Caz was when his story began. (Start with the e-novella
"Penric's Demon" or the Baen collection <i>Penric's
Progress</i>.)<br>

translations. That choice is not up to me, however, but rather to
the foreign publishers' purchasing editors. I'm sure my agent, who
they should know how to find, would be happy to hear from them.<br>
<br>
Also hoping, L.</span></div>

entirely upon the story being told. Nonlinear worked well for
<i>Catch-22</i>, evoking the chaos and absurdity of war and ending
in a climax of revelation. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, while
linear, was written in omniscient, which allowed some temporal flex
as needed. Most of my work (all, come to think) is
third-person-personal, past-tense, and chronological, following the
point-of-view characters and allowing the reader to learn things as
they do. Really, "better" is not a useful word in criticism, unless
it includes the information, "Better for what?"<br>

for the 4th time currently. Recently I re-read The Spirit Ring

many possibilities and hints for more. Please forgive me if you've

enjoyed <i>The Spirit Ring</i>. Well, truly, the answer is, because
I wrote something else instead -- the whole run of Miles books
through the 90s, from <i>Mirror Dance</i> through <i>A Civil
Campaign</i>. Which worked out pretty well for me...<br>
<br>
Had tSR been a surprise bestseller, rather than a surprise
non-bestseller, I might have had more push to get back to its
world, but instead I took what I had learned about how I wanted to
write fantasy and went on to <i>The Curse of Chalion</i>, which is
still spinning out aspects to explore, gosh, 20 years later.<br>
<br>
But I'm happy <i>The Spirit Ring</i> is still finding new readers
almost <i>30</i> years later.<br>

There are the two new Baen dead-tree collections, the first
hardcover, <i>Penric's Progress</i>, just out, containing the first
three novellas, and the second, <i>Penric's Travels</i>, with the
next three, due in May. Baen paperbacks will follow at the usual
remove. (Baen also has world rights on these paper volumes, so no
problems ordering overseas.)<br>
<br>
Also, "The Orphans of Raspay" will be out from Subterranean Press
in their usual deluxe hardcover come summer. I'll have more about
that on my blog as dates firm up. For it to be collected by Baen,
I'd have to write two more, however, so that would be a while.<br>
<br>
And, of course, Blackstone/Audible/Downpour has the audio versions.
Also some public libraries.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lots of options. B&amp;N online and Amazon are two sources
for paper as well as ebooks. Baen should have some distribution
through regular bookstores. SubPress has a different business model
-- you need to go online to their website or to a few specialty
stores like Uncle Hugo's for their offerings, though I believe some
regular bookstores can order them in by request.<br>
<br>
(Not quite my mom's old quip about the lazy man who said, "Just
roll me over and stick it in me pocket," but darn close.)<br>
<br>
Good luck --<br>
<br>
L.<br>
<br>
(Oh, and as I write this, "Knife Children" is pending real-soon-now
from SubPress as well. I'll blog it when it ships.)</span></div>

summer in your blog, you said you would let us know when/if a date
was available for the audio version of "The Orphans of Raspay" - so
much anxiety from 2 little letters. It has been over 6 months. Any
chance you can at least erase the "if" and let the torrents of hope
and anticipation resume? I love Grover Gardner's reading of your
work. Please let us know it will continue.</a></div>

most extensive place to see me piffle on about my writing is at the

"https://vorkosigan.fandom.com/wiki/Author_Interviews">https://vorkosigan.fandom.com/wiki/Au...</a>
That should keep you busy for a while. The other two fairly useful
places are in <i>The Vorkosigan Companion</i> and <i>Sidelines:
Talks and Essays</i>.<br>
<br>
And, as always, Pat Wrede's blog on writing is good value,

Beyond that, I've pretty much lurched from project to project over
the years not quite randomly, but rather like a person scrambling
from one stepping stone to the next across a river, or scaling a
climb one piton and some rope-work at a time, each step both
creating and constraining the possibilities for the next, teaching
me a bit more each time in the doing. I've learned to write by
writing, on-the-job training. Possibly not efficient, but there ya
go.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>"Good" (which I
don't think is really a very useful word, when talking about books)
is a quality that does not actually lie in the book, though most
people unthinkingly or carelessly assume it does. It actually
describes an emotional response on the part of the reader to the
text in question, and is thus a transactional event varying with
each reading and reader.<br>
<br>
So asking the text (or its author) why a story is good aims the
question in the wrong direction. You have to ask each reader, since
it's only inside their heads that the experience(s) of "a good
read" lies. Now, what people will <i>say</i> when asked will depend
heavily on how the question is framed.<br>
<br>
In general, I think anyone with the nous to see "message" incoming
is right to duck, but maybe that's just me.<br>

Goodreads setup makes to easy to dash off a note, and it does give
me a handy record of what I've read. It can be disturbing, looking
back over my list, how many things on it were forgettable (and duly
forgotten); some quite the opposite, and with little relation to

gaming generationally -- when it was coming on as an activity, I
was deep into raising kids and booting up my writing career,
leaving less than zero time for anything that didn't directly serve
same. So I missed gaming as an influence. Although I can see how it
has affected other writers and media, which makes for an
interesting study in narrative modes.<br>
<br>
But I'm glad GURPS led you to my books I was hoping it might work
like that. Btw, <i>GURPS Vorkosigan</i> sourcebook author Genevieve
Cogman has gone on to her own writing career with the <i>The
Invisible Library</i> series, which you might find fun.<br>

<i>Penric's Travels</i> is a hardcover collection/reprint of my
original Penric & Desdemona e-novellas "Penric's Mission, "Mira's
Last Dance", and "The Prisoner of Limnos". Following, of course,
from January's <i>Penric's Progress</i>, which collected the first
three novellas in the series chronologically. I'm very pleased with
the art and design for both volumes.<br>
<br>
I suspect book distribution, along with everything else, is going
to be quite disrupted for a time, which may affect the volume's
immediate availability with respect to its hoped-for release date,
but books don't spoil. Folks should be able to obtain it through
normal bookselling channels in due course.<br>

large question to answer in this tiny typing box... Year by year, I
abandon old work and engage with new, so the older stuff would fade
to a complete blur if it weren't for me needing to proofread
reprints, which brings them back on the tide. I only wince some...
I am certainly not the same person I was in 1982 when I began
writing.<br>

My response to reader-response has shifted to a more relaxed mode,
as I am not so anxious to make-or-break it. This is all to the

have missed all my blog posts about <i>Penric's Progress</i> a
collection of the first 3 novellas, released as a hardcover by Baen
Books in January, and <i>Penric's Travels</i>, a collection of the
next 3, upcoming in May (or thereabouts -- book distribution being
disrupted just now. But it'll catch up eventually.)<br>
<br>
Prior to that, there were all the Subterranean Press hardcover
chapbooks of the individual novellas. "Penric's Demon" is long sold
out, but most of the others are still floating around -- Uncle
Hugo's Science Fiction Bookstore here in Minneapolis still has most
of them, signed, and does mail order. And, of course, they have
plenty of copies of <i>Penric's Progress</i>. Dreamhaven Book &
Comics also has some. Likewise Amazon and B&amp;N.<br>
<br>
You get them by ordering them -- waiting for them to spontaneously
turn up at any particular bookstore is a crapshoot. Check the
assorted websites.<br>

technique that works for me is to write books that sell themselves.
After that, sales is their job, best carried on without my

All the other publicity antler-dances are far too much work. Unless
the writer is a high-energy extrovert who enjoys such activities as
a hobby, the way some people enjoy jumping out of perfectly good
airplanes.<br>

That said, of the 3 e-vendor platforms, iBooks, Nook, and Kindle,
we use for my indie work, Amazon's sales are largest, about
two-thirds, with the other third split between the other two.<br>

remember in the preface for one of your books you mentioned there
was a Miles Vorkosigan movie planned, but that it thankfully never
came to fruition because of the script. Do you still feel that way
about a movie adaptation? Or, if you could pick a director for an
adaptation, who would you choose?</a></div>

enough about directors to choose one, and, let's be clear, it is
the producer, the one with the money, who does the choosing. S/he
picks the directors and it flows down from there.<br>
<br>
I am much less hot for a media adaptation that I was when I was
younger and poorer, only partly because the money would no longer
make any great difference in my life. When it is so hard to even
get a cover that accurately represents my story, a single still
image rendered by one person, getting an enormous committee with
multiple other motivations in play to do so seems exponentially
less likely.<br>
<br>
Whatever came out the far end of this movie-making machine might
(or might not) be a good advertisement for my books, but it would
no longer be my story.<br>

"/questions/1814332-i-am-trying-to-find-the-title-of-a-book-i">I am
trying to find the title of a book I read maybe 10 years ago.
Probably a harlequin presents. All I remember is that a woman that
wants a baby possibly hires a man to spend months at her house,
seems like a remote farm with land, to get her pregnant. I think he
was a bit of a stranger. I do remember her getting her cycle and
his thoughts on how pitiful she was and that it drained her energy.
Thx for any info?</a></div>

Long enough that I can't remember without looking it up; ever since
they threw me (and a lot of other folks) off my original blog host
MySpace. I have no idea if MySpace even still exists, but they
erased everyone's files behind them.<br>
<br>
(Goes and looks it up.) My profile page says February 2012, but
this site was being run as a fan thing before I arrived and took up
squatter's rights. My first book-notes seem to date from then, so
it's probably about right.)<br>

I like this hosting site; it stays reliably book-oriented.<br>

A new one for me, though I have it on my Kindle. I'd started it a
while back, then tripped over my belief that it was the sequel to
<i>Swordheart</i> (which was a delightful tale.) I need to restart
it without spending many pages of misreading. expecting it to be
some other book.<br>
<br>
I <i>really</i> want to know more about the Dervish (in SH), though
I suspect the author may be more interested in the other member of
the unfortunate triumvirate, wossername.<br>

Hard to say. Doing in vegetation may be too slow a process to dump
hot chaos in a hurry; or it may be a skill Pen acquires later on,
should a future plot require it.<br>
<br>
Revisiting Joen's leashed sorcerers in <i>Paladin of Souls</i>
might give an idea of the wilder possibilities.<br>
<br>
I have a fleeting memory of Sophie in <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>
doing in the weeds while in a bad mood one day, but I can't

Mm, it was a short gap, but perhaps made to appear shorter by the
fact I was keeping quiet about the work until my test readers could
see the final draft, and I could get some sense of how it would be
received despite the unfortunate coincidence of subject matter and
timing. There was also some back-and-forthing about the title and
cover before we got it right, which, for similar reasons, I didn't
particularly want to air to fans.<br>
<br>
It seems to have all come together in the end, though. I'm looking
forward to a summer off, after all the flurry of PR this month and
leading in to Nebula Weekend.<br>

occurred to me that, when Penric stays anywhere for a while, there
may be a significant decrease in the local population of bugs and
vermin. I'm no ecologist, but I've heard about the dramatic and
unexpected consequences of reintroducing wolves into the
Yellowstone National Park; perhaps wiping out pests could have
other unexpected ecological consequences. Is this an interesting
thought?</a></div>

It is, but Penric is only one dude. And sorcerers generally are
rather thin on the ground. I don't think the kinds of flies and
fleas and mosquitoes and ticks that bite people are in any more
danger of magical eradication than whatever dent humans have made
in their populations after centuries of trying in non-magical ways.
(I.e., none.) Cockroaches ditto.<br>
<br>
Though if anything, magical eradication might be better for the
ecology because it could be far more selective.<br>
<br>
There are also lots of plant and animal diseases and pests of
interest, glancingly touched on in the most recent tale.<br>

Alas, I do not create during my insomnia. I mainly lie there and
fume.<br>
<br>
It also steals my creative and writing brain the next day, because
of the deep fatigue, headache, and body ache that result from too
little sleep. Sleep meds help general function, when they work at
all, but then have drug hangovers the next day that also rob me of
higher brain function, so there's no win there.<br>

Insomnia. Sounds dramatic, actually sucks. Not recommended for

Captain Vorpatril's Alliance, where Morozov explains Ivan's

Prince Xav wasn't next in line for the throne after Emperor Yuri,

the past it's been referenced that Salic descent was important for

Xav was a half brother of Yuri, of different mothers. He was born
well before Yuri's mother died, Dorca finally married his
significant other, and Xav was legitimated. So Xav's legitimacy was
always a bit dodgy.<br>
<br>
More critically, Mad Yuri had Xav's only son murdered (his
daughters survived) so Xav had no successor when Yuri was brought
down and they had to figure out a new emperor. He was also old and
grieving and very, very tired. Piotr was in a similar state, having
just lost his favored heir. The two put their heads together and
decided to headhunt Ezar instead of putting too-young Aral in the
hot seat.<br>
<br>
Good question for historical speculators whether things would have
gone differently if Piotr's older son had lived.<br>

The Barrayaran imperial succession, like successions in real
history, are pretty much a matter of the moment. Precedents may
break or be broken, or hold, depending on what the people with
power around the events want to have happen at the time.<br>
<br>
"Power" by the way, is a trickily undefined term that usually
sneaks by unexamined. I'd define it most broadly as "the flow of
will in human activities", which, if you back-translate it into
most of the places the word is bandied about, has some odd
effects.<br>
<br>
E.g, such slogans as "Speaking Truth to...The Flow Of Will in Human
Activities". Hmmm.<br>

(Leaving aside the definition of "Truth.")<br>

question hasn't been asked yet, at least I couldn't find it: is the
epidemic theme of the new Penric novella chance or do you write
that fast? Second question, books remind me sometimes of paintings,
yours, especially the novellas, of water-colors. I'm trying to
figure out why, is it the story or something like rythm? Wish you a

The co-incidence of "The Physicians of Vilnoc" with current events
was accidental. I'd planned the story last year, based on an
amalgam of earlier historical models, run through the peculiarities
of the world of the five gods. But it got off to a later start than
I'd thought it would, and so the present pandemic more-or-less rose
up around it.<br>
<br>
Not writing it was, at that point deep in the creative process, a
non-option, though I did wonder for a while about finishing but not
publishing it. I finally concluded my readers could be trusted to
decide for themselves whether it was anything they wanted to read
right now. The story will, presumably, be around for years yet.<br>
<br>
I like the watercolors analogy. Interesting personal
connection.<br>

The story is so new, it's barely been submitted to Blackstone, but
we certainly intend to do so. I expect they will want to license it
as usual.<br>
<br>
When the contract actually comes through, I'll likely mention it on
my blog, but really, the pertinent news will be later on when they
have a release date. I would assume Blackstone's business is as
disrupted as everyone else's at the moment, so you probably need to
build some extra time into your expectations.<br>

Hm, glad you're asking for "one of" instead of an impossible just
one. I am at the moment considering whether I want to dip into a
reread of <i>Pandora Hearts</i>, at least the first 22 manga
volumes, and there's a new T. Kingfisher waiting in my queue. A
roundup of some of my reading in recent years may be seen here:<br>

Lots of Great Courses lately, but since they are vids not books
there's no such handy way to mention them on Goodreads.<br>

The story isn't due to be released on audio till mid-July. I think
what you are seeing on Amazon US is the pre-order page. When the
novella actually goes up for downloading it should appear on all
the Amazons in the usual way.<br>

Your mistyping above may actually be on-point, given the topic of
the latest Penric & Desdemona novella, "The Physicians of Vilnoc",
but that, I finally decided, must be for the individual readers to
choose for themselves.<br>

You already have an email for me. Goodreads has a private messaging
system, which any registered Goodreads user (such as yourself) can
use to message any other GR user (such as me.)<br>
<br>
You are not the first baffled person to resort to the Author
Q&amp;A column, which is designed for public discussion of my
writing, for other questions. Perhaps some commenters below could
offer instruction on how to use the Goodreads mail system. (I don't
offhand know if the messaging is limited to the officially
befriended or not.)<br>
<br>
I would note that other public information is usually available on
writers' Goodreads Profile pages or in Wikipedia entries.<br>

Both. My first notions were for an older Penric, but prior
experience with series has shown me that skipping over large
swathes of time tends to limit what stories can later go in
between. Besides, I thought I could get to know him better by
beginning at his beginning.<br>
<br>
The particular details of each novella were developed one by one,
in the writing. I like surprising myself. (And you all.)<br>
<br>
I arrived at what eventually became the novel <i>Falling Free</i>,
decades back, by a similar process. My first notions were for the
race of quaddies <i>in situ</i> in their asteroid colony in Miles's
time, but then I reasoned back to their necessary beginning, Leo
popped up, and other characters and the story began to coalesce
around him.<br>

been thinking that the Sharing Knife books are your strongest and
have the most profound emotional punch. My theory is that the
settings come directly from your home culture and resonate
especially well with readers from the same historical atmosphere.
There’s endless presumed knowledge you can draw on and—no small
thing—a rich vernacular to exploit. I wonder if it feels that way
from the author’s perspective?</a></div>

<i>The Sharing Knife</i> tetralogy has had quite varied reader
response, from folks who like it as you do to those who totally
bounce off it, for a variety of reasons. (Including the perennial
"This wasn't the [name some other book] I wanted to have been
reading!" Also, "It's bad, <i>because</i> it's a romance!", which I
find a touch <i>a priori</i>.) One can get a sense of the array by
a cruise through the assorted-star Amazon reviews, or here on
Goodreads.<br>
<br>
<i>I</i> think my 1600-page anti-epic is a major and original and
deeply considered work, but I'm not prepared to argue with those
who feel otherwise.<br>
<br>
Anyway, standard writerly kvetching about reviews aside, I'm always
very pleased to run across a reader who sees it my way. Thank you
for your thoughtful reading!<br>
<br>

Eliot wrote always with a sense of failure and doom. Nabokov was
fully aware of his greatness. I think you must be somewhat aware.
Not wishing for a response here, I’ll just say that talent at a
certain level carries the obligation to write, especially if it’s
not fading. We’re all at our full powers only so long, but some
writers soar well into “retirement” years. I’m afraid you’re still
on obligation status.?</a></div>

I am, thankfully, neither Eliot nor Nabokov, and I paid my dues
with interest long ago. I don't do obligations anymore, nor

I read parts of my first book, published 11 years and books ago, to
get details for a sequel. I was surprised at the skill of that
alien time-lost author. Have you ever experienced anything similar?
By the way, as I do every few years, I'm re-reading the Vorkosigan
stories starting with Cordelia's books. I'm buying the ebook
versions despite having the print books. Eyesight changes make
ebooks easier to read.</a></div>

The Vorkosiverse is secular, although individuals may have personal
religious beliefs. In Chalion the gods are real, present,
dangerous, and woven into most aspects of society. In the Sharing
Knife world the gods seem equally real but have abandoned humanity.
How did these approaches evolve? Was it fun playing with religion
and society like that?</a></div>

Nope, the two series have no connection. Unrelated worlds. Both
have rather restrained, non-visible magic systems, but that just
represents their author's taste.<br>

This is so far left to the imagination of the readers. But one may
presume it is almost as disorienting for the demon as for the host.
Also, every demon is as or more different from one another as every
person. It might be possible for the personalities to disagree,
although as time goes on they do tend to meld, but at the moment of
the host's death there will only be a small number of choices in
range. We've twice, with Hallana and Ruchia, seen demons jump to
someone nearby other than the new host the Temple presented, but
that was more likely disagreement between the demon and its
handlers than internal to the demon. Probably...<br>

I've noticed interpretations of revelations in GJ&amp;RQ as meaning
that Barrayar's victory in the first Cetagandan war was somehow not
real. Yet the fact that one side refrained from using weapons of
mass destruction doesn't make its defeat less real. US didn't use
nukes in Vietnam, USSR in Afghanistan. Yet they still actually lost
those wars & same goes for Cetaganda.<br>

It seems unlikely. The Vorkosigan and the fantasy series are still
licensed to their original publishers.<br>
<br>
NESFA Press had a go at producing my first several VK books, which
had been paperback originals, as hardcovers, and they're still
around as well.<br>
<br>
(Also, the vision of having to proofread them all <i>yet again</i>
is kinda horrifying, but that's just me.)<br>

question about the demon's different personalities disagreeing made
me wonder. Does a well developed demon like Desdemona have any
thoughts that are separate than the previous hosts? Besides the
urge to chaos. Penric refers to Desdemona as all of them
collectively, but there also seems to be some sort of unity of
thought when he isn't calling on a specific personality.</a></div>

It's fluid, but it does appear that the personalities blend around
the edges over time, with the older ones less distinct than the
newer. The memories mostly remain distinct, but the presenting
persona becomes more of a consensus.<br>
<br>
There is some interesting recent research in neurobiology that
suggests the the parts of a brain actually cooperate in something
of a consensus fashion in generating awareness.<br>

The text never specifies exactly, but you could work out an
approximation from the ages of her children. For one thing, we
don't know exactly how long she lived in Cardegoss right after she
was widowed, getting more and more strange, before her mother came
to remove her to more out-of-the-way Valenda, at what instigation
we also do not know. "About ten years" would be a fair guess.<br>

Not especially. Dag's is not a world of schools and certifications,
nor of answers to be found in the back of the book, though it
certainly contains ad hoc apprenticeships. Pretty much everyone has
to be an autodidact, there, plus... whatever one calls it when
small groups of people boot up each other, which is much the way
the world of grownups works generally.<br>
<br>
...Really, there <i>ought</i> to be a plural form of the autodidact
concept. Besides "writers' group".<br>

It's merely a variant. There are only two choices of age-spreads
for romantic partners; dead-even ages, or some degree of uneven
ages. You are just noticing the more uneven ones preferentially.
(Although indeed it can add a dramatic element, depending, like any
other disjoint cultural aspect that must be worked through by one's
characters.) There are lots of even or nearly even pairs as well,
that pass by unremarked. Miles and Ekaterin, ferex. Ingrey and
Ijada are pretty close, as are Fiametta and Thur, Ista and Illvin,
Simon and Alys... the list goes on, but no one makes breathless
comments about the near-age-pairs; invisible, I guess.<br>

New reader here, really enjoy your books. Since you have written
books of both the fantasy and sci-fi genres I was wondering if it
was possible to combine the two? Would you have to minimise the
magical element to it or just make magic follow a certain set of
rules such as other forces do?</a></div>

Other writers certainly have combined the genres; perhaps the
commenters could chime in below with favorite examples.<br>
<br>
I happen to think that genres are a continuum, rather than discrete
boxes. (Actually, I think the world of books is an amorphous mass
over which we drop assorted organizing and varyingly arbitrary
mental grids. Also the world of people, but that's another
discussion.) Speaking only for myself as a writer, I would classify
anything as "fantasy" in the genre sense if the supernatural, in
the book-world, is something real. This does not capture the dozens
of subgenres that have other kinds of elements of unreality, from
FTL travel to alternate history to, for that matter, fictional
characters. But that's a much broader and less useful definition of
"fantasy".<br>
<br>
And then there's the numinous, of which the SFnal version is
probably "sense of wonder". Which is not about rules, but about
evoking an emotion of awe in the reader. Which is another slice
through it altogether.<br>

It should all be on this page. <a target="_blank" rel=

Note especially the several links for further explanations,
including the frequently asked questions and the contact-us links
at the bottom.<br>
<br>
My experiences are unhelpful, since, besides being several years
out of date, as I recall I just strolled in and took over my site
previously set up by fans. Further tweaking by me involved
following the instructions with some experimental back-and-forthing
since, indeed, it's not always clear what to do even if one's first
language is English. (It would likely help to be bilingual in
Computer, which I am not.)<br>
<br>
Too, if an entry is not required, one can always leave it blank for
the moment.<br>

Barrayar does have dogs; Dono is mentioned as owning a large and
unruly one, not to mention young Donna's ill-fated puppy. There is
also a problem of feral dogs mentioned iirc in "The Flowers of
Vashnoi".<br>
<br>
Young Miles does not appear to have ever owned a dog, so they
haven't been front and center.<br>

I am not a math person, tho' I did get up to differential calculus,
decades ago in college. Long forgotten now. I do like the
pictures/graphs generated by math -- those, I find intuitively
illuminating. I only do or consult on math to get
time-speed-distance and suchlike calculations in my tales

I've finally got the equipment to make one myself, but I was

considering posting the design (nothing special, just a logo for

The old source was Steve Salaba at Softwear Toys 'n Tees, who was
actually licensed, and sold VK stuff in assorted SF convention

mail order, if you want to save yourself steps. My brief websearch
turns up an address in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which sounds about
right, but the website link goes to something in a foreign language

First, congrats for getting out. I've heard from a surprising
number of women who felt Ekaterin's story spoke to them, so you are
not alone.<br>
<br>
Back to fiction, I'm actually not sure what some folks think
Ekaterin should be <i>doing</i> with her life, more than the three
or four jobs she's shouldering already. Nor how she could fit it
into the time allotted to her. I suspect it's simply that they do
not value the same things she does.<br>
<br>
(The systematic and rather toxic denigration of domesticity and
caregiving in our culture is a subject too large for this tiny
typing box, but the readerly recoil from such a threat to status,
even vicarious, can get quite heated. It gives me, as the kids say,
thinky thoughts.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, standard answer, nothing new in the Vorkosigan direction
is happening at this time. It's a frequently voiced question,
although the proposed suggestions for subject matter are as varied
and wildly contradictory as the readers.<br>

With difficulty. For the books set on our world-ish, I can use
real-world names, calibrated for cultures and times, but in the
pre-internet days finding such wasn't as easy; my thin local phone
book had rather slim pickings. Nowadays one can Google [country
name] surnames/popular names for men/whatever, and be spoiled for
accurate choice.<br>
<br>
For my fantasy worlds, I've found it speeds things up to generate
name lists in advance, from which I can just select if a new
character or place pops up. (Main characters get first pick and
more cogitation.) One trick to make names sound as if they all come
from the same language base is to pick a place on a map (or the
index in a history book), take the names found, break them down
into syllables, and remix them into euphonious and pronounce-able
new names. (I'm also trending to "shorter", these days.) Then stare
at the list till the right name for this person or place presents
itself. A prudent last step, which also wasn't possible before the
internet, is to do a quick name check and make sure one hasn't
accidentally given a character/place a made-up name that is
something unfortunate in another language.<br>

No, but nearly a year went by for Pen and company between the two
novellas, during which the characters' lives did not stand still.
Thus the references.<br>

As for what to pick next, it will entirely depend on what aspects
you are reading for, or against. Readers are all over the map on
this question, reasonably enough I suppose as my stories are not
all the same.<br>
<br>
I have two fantasy series, the World of the Five Gods and The
Sharing Knife. (Plus the lonely stand-alone <i>The Spirit
Ring</i>.) The first series is medievaloid-European in inspiration,
and the stories are spread around its world but not always closely
connected. The second is inspired by, but is NOT, the
pre-industrial American Midwest, quite deliberately not lords 'n
swords, but deliberately with a strong romance backbone, and is one
continuous story in 4 books.<br>
<br>
The first starts with <i>The Curse of Chalion</i>; the second with
<i>The Sharing Knife: Beguilement</i>. I'd say your best shot is to
try the first in each, and see if either grabs you. Good luck!<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>

Mm, hadn't considered that one. Hallana's demon didn't emerge as a

off Amazon Japan, ferex. In the US, not sure.<br>

Nope, I don't have any control over this. You'd have to ask
Blackstone Audiobooks. But I don't think they revise extant
audiobooks.<br>
<br>
Some of the Penric novellas don't have chapters, depending on what
I'm doing with viewpoint cues.<br>

I suppose if anyone knows and tricks or hacks for this, they could

If you scroll down the Amazon page of the book you are interested
in, on the left just under the box with the yellow bars telling
what percentage of reviews each star ranking has, there is a box to
click on labeled "write a customer review". Click on it, and it
will take you to a page labeled "create review" with a composition
pane. It should be self-evident from there.<br>

A whole lot of little subliminal (and not so subliminal) things
adding up gradually, but probably the final test was when Bel
leaned in and kissed Mark, and got a very un-Miles-like
reaction.<br>
<br>
Their flirting was a practiced near-joke by that time, and Miles
normally would have ducked and passed it off with a laugh, not
panicked and frozen.<br>

Depends on what you mean by "first"; I've had many, starting from a
writing assignment in third grade, going on through junior high
efforts that would be called fanfiction today (the term was not to
my knowledge invented yet in the early 60s, tho' it wouldn't be
long), through to my first finished professional novelette that
didn't sell, through to my first novel that did. Much of this is
covered here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.amazon.com/Sidelines-Essays-Lois-McMaster-Bujold-ebook/dp/B00BW5SW66/">
https://www.amazon.com/Sidelines-Essa...</a> I'd direct you
particularly to the occasional essay titled "My First Novel" for an
answer at some length.<br>
<br>
I was trying to write from very early on, though I lost track of
myself for several long stretches in there. It took till my early
thirties to claim that identity with sufficient determination to
see it through.<br>
<br>
(Also, lots and lots of reading.)<br>

It's not up to me, alas. Some producer with a ton o' cash for
making media would need to license it.<br>

That's correct.<br>
<br>
It is, however, available on Kindle, Nook, and iTunes. I know you
can download the free Kindle reading app to most devices, and be
reading in minutes; I would guess the same goes for the other two
platforms. So I don't think you are actually cut off from my ebooks
except by your own choice.<br>

Nothing gets rid of flies, especially in a world of abundant animal
manure. Trust me (and Mark Twain) on this point. And our world has
been going after mosquitoes for decades with every tool imaginable,
with very little impact. I really don't think a handful of
sorcerers are going to make a dent in these very resilient
species.<br>
<br>
Actually, sorcery ought to be more eco-friendly than our
insecticides, since it can be directed to the single biting
disease-bearing pest, and leave everything else untouched.<br>

Lois! In the Sharing Knife series, it's described that the
Lakewalkers shield their ground by turning it sideways to the world
(or a concept along those lines). To me, this sounds like an object
in a higher dimension going out of view in a lower dimension, for
example, how 3D objects might seem to disappear if moved when
viewed from a 2D plane. Did you think of this when creating this
magic system?</a></div>

The name began as a mere throw-away line in another story,
something of a joke or pun. The development came later.<br>
<br>
That's the hazard with throw-away lines in a long series. They can
come back on the tide to haunt you.<br>

Nothing personal intended toward the town in Wyoming, though I had
been through the area as a child and thus knew the name.<br>

"/questions/1918070-on-the-subject-of-who-could-possibly-play">On
the subject of who could possibly play Miles in a Golden-Age TV
adaptation, I've been struck by Alex Høgh Andersen's portrayal of
"Ivar the Boneless" in Vikings, from mid-season 4 forward. He's
born without the use of legs but becomes one of the most powerful
figures in Vikings history. Unlike Miles, Ivar is a truly awful
person--but charismatic and supremely determined. Maybe file this
away in case HBO calls?</a></div>

In the ten years before he went to Lodi and then Cedonia, some such
must have happened in some form, if brief. A sister's wedding,
perhaps, or some business that took Rolsch to Martensbridge. Pen
might/might not have made it to his mother's funeral -- a hundred
miles (each way) was farther at that tech level. There would
certainly have been exchanges of letters. But Pen would be
increasingly growing away from the concerns of Jurald Court;
interesting to him but not vital anymore.<br>

I usually run a Goodreads blog post soon after e-pub, for both
spoiler fan-discussion space, and typo reportage. It's a good
system to both avoid duplication, and collect all the errata in one
place. So that's the best place to report to save things from being
lost in any of my several shuffles.<br>

I'm always pleased to learn that another writer likes my work. And
surprised -- I know how tight their time and attention are to
devote to other writers' works. ...Naming no names right now
because it's first thing in the morning and I haven't had my tea
yet, but there have been several, over the years. Well, Catherine
Asaro comes to mind because she got me to write a novella for her
romance-SF crossover anthology. Which is how you all came to have
"Winterfair Gifts".<br>

I'm very glad you find my work heartening, but I do have to say I
didn't start out to represent anything but the characters
themselves. All sorts of characters, in all sorts of situations
(that interest me, a necessary caveat), revealing themselves and
their stories to me as I write them.<br>
<br>
I do think that readers generally pick out and respond to aspects
of any tale that resonate with them, regardless of how complex the
tale may be. The obvious negative form of this is triggering, or
special individual allergies to whatever story element it may be;
the less obvious positive form is loving a work for particular
elements it presents despite what else it contains. I compare this
with how one person's hearing may be especially sensitive or muted
in some specific range of frequencies.<br>
<br>
Reading a wide range of reviews of the same work gives insight into
this effect. All reading the same words, responses wildly varied;
therefore, what's happening can't be in the words themselves, but
in that other half of the text-reader partnership. (The half the
writer can't control, I note.)<br>

Short request is, Don't, but more helpfully, any Goodreads member
whom I have friended can use the GR private messaging system to
send email within the system. The trick, it turns out, is that one
must have been friended to make the address box populate. This
isn't hard to achieve, since I friend pretty much anyone who asks,
there being too many to vet.<br>

As of tonight, 10/21, the upload attempted last Thursday has still
not emerged on the other end. Repeated attempts to reupload have
run afoul of various blockages. B&amp;N's system won't allow
another upload of the same thing, I'm told, though once it does go
through, updates should be possible, we hope.<br>
<br>
So yep, we know, but the problem isn't one we can solve from our
side. We'll keep trying, but it may be awhile. (Think of how long
paper publishing takes...)<br>
<br>
Meantime, yep, iBooks and Kindle are working OK.<br>

(Writing at the end of October 2020): The novella has only just
been offered to SubPress, ink not dry on the contract, so nothing
definitive there yet. Since there are now 3 loose novellas, enough
to make up market weight in word-count, I would hope for another
omnibus someday, but the earliest that could happen is one year
after the last SubPress volume is published.<br>
<br>
My next thing due out from SubPress is "The Physicians of Vilnoc",
which has been scheduled for release July 2021.<br>
<br>
It's likewise only just been offered to Blackstone for audio, too
soon for any news from that quarter as well. I'll post it on my
blog if/when there is.<br>
<br>
We've only placed the first of the e-text novellas, "Penric's
Demon", on Overdrive so far, along with a handful of other titles
for experiment. They remain available as far as I know. Sales have
been disappointing compared to the extended hassle of getting them
up to Overdrive's specs, so I don't think we'll be doing that as an
indie again. The regular publishers and Blackstone have their own
arrangements.<br>
<br>
Remember the Baen paper versions for your libraries, please!<br>
<br>

Saints of the Son are not impossible (that shaman in "Penric and
the Shaman" was nearly one, functionally) but they would be rare.
As are all saints, really. But Pen is more professionally likely to
run into them than most folks would be; a biased sampler, as it
were.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what may turn up in a future story. I generally have
to write them to find out, myself.<br>

Just a coincidence. I tend to gravitate to certain names or
syllable collections as seeming euphonious to me, which, if I'm not
careful, can lead to inadvertent duplications. Illyrica iirc is a
variant on Illyria, which is or was a real place. I think. I got it
out of Shakespeare, so not swearing to its historicity.<br>

Typos in printed books are beyond correction, natch. If it's a
recent e-edition, well, maybe, but it involves putting my e-handler
through a hassle. But there is space for typo reportage in the
spoiler-discussion posts I put up on my blog after every new
e-work. You could stick it in there, I suppose, even if it's not
for the story under discussion. Keeping it all in one place is
good. (Actual discussion of the stories is even better. I notice
folks tend to get pretty distracted by minutia. Not sure just
why.)<br>

words, a moment of humor? No room here for examples alas (although

My input has varied wildly over the years, from none to much, and a
lot of experiment has shown that how much input I have has no
relationship to how satisfactory the outcome is. Regardless of what
you ask artists for (especially in words), what you get back will
be related to the pictures in their heads, or maybe their favorite
reference materials, and not at all to the pictures in yours. Words
are nearly useless; giving them pictures helps some (an old tip
from Jim Baen) but not much. It's a crap shoot.<br>
<br>
I had the same amount of input to all four of the <i>Sharing
Knife</i>, covers, same artist. What I got back was never the
picture in my head I'd started out with, and sometimes not even
what prelim sketches had led me to expect.<br>
<br>
When one has been handed a finished painting, there is very little
that can be done to revise it. First, the artist, who imagined it
was just fine, gets very cranky about being asked to go back, and
not only because they aren't being paid for that. Note also another
limit is that all paper book covers are contracted, ordered, and
paid for by the publisher, not the writer.<br>
<br>
I've also noticed a phenomenon in myself which I've mentally dubbed
"rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i>" If I'm
presented with a piece of art that is Just Wrong, I'll fix upon
little details that seem easy to repaint, getting pickier and
pickier about them as they fail to fix the underlying problem. (And
getting the artist more and more irritated, as one naturally would
be.) The <i>real</i> solution is to sink the whole boat and start
over, which I can only do if I'm paying for it (twice), and there
is no hard publication deadline. I've done this once, to good
effect, but that was very far into my lifelong learning process. I
should do an illustrated blog post about that one, some slow
day.<br>
<br>
Artists will argue that covers are just advertisements, little
billboards that have done their job if they get the prospective
purchaser to pick up, or pick out, the book, and the details don't
matter. I argue that they are the very first moment of the reading
experience just as much as the opening page of text, coloring the
reader's expectations about what comes after. Wrong covers start
the readers off on the wrong foot, from which they may not easily
recover.<br>

with the chorus: Oh Lord, I'm Stuck in Lodi Again. Oh, and THANK
YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!</a></div>

There are dozens of real-world places named Lodi, mostly I suspect
after the original one in Italy. I'd selected the city name
somewhat idly back when it was just a throw-away line in an earlier
Penric story, with no expectation of its ever becoming a live
setting, because it sounded suitably Italianate, implying but
without obviously being Venice. And so I was stuck with it. (Same
goes for the planet Jackson's Whole, btw. No, it never had a hidden
meaning, it was just a bit of word-play.)<br>
<br>
Glad you enjoyed the story! The filched canal-city
setting-inspiration was a lot of fun, once I got down to it, and
suggested all kinds of useful plot developments.<br>
<br>
(And, yep, I also remember the old CCR song.)<br>

Lois, You've brought me endless hours of joy. Thank you. How are
you able to bring so many dark aspects (I'm thinking specifically
Mirror Dance with Mark and Ryoval, etc.) but the story feels
uplifting? I compare this to The Road which I still feel scarred
by. Character trajectory is part of the answer but I feel I am
missing something.</a></div>

I've not read <i>The Road</i>, so I can't compare and contrast. But
everyone processes the same work of fiction differently, sometimes
by a little, sometimes by a lot. So the answer, if any, is more
likely to be found in you than in me.<br>

I don't have a question? I just wanted to thank you VERY much for
what I like to think of as the 'Cordelia Trilogy', 'Shards',
'Barrayar' and 'Gentleman Jole'. I love all of the books in the
Vorkosigan saga but these are the ones I keep going back to for
Cordelia and her outlook and 'do the next thing' common sense. I
came to your books late but they're regularly re-read. Thanks

Sure. People can convince themselves of <i>anything</i>. And the
appearances of the gods are usually subtle, through the material
world or in visions and dreams, uncheckable by outside observers.
(The Temples do have systems for sensitives to check each other,
which reduces false positives and negatives greatly -- much, much
harder for witch-hunts or spiritual con artists to gain traction --
but a sufficiently determined person could dismiss this.)<br>

SubPress is sold out, but Hugo's can still get a few copies,
signed, in either trade or leatherbound. Since copies are priced at
$295 out in the general collectable resale market (well, the one
copy I see for sale on Amazon, not that anyone's biting at that
price), it will probably be offered at above list price, but not
that high. Check with Hugo's by email and see what they can do for
you.<br>

your works ever since picking up Shards of Honour in a humble

discussed in Captain Vorpatril's Alliance, it got me thinking about
the issue. Did Gregor ever establish a line of succession in the
event of his death? Would Miles or Ivan be at the top of the list
or perhaps would Aral be called back onto the Imperial camp

I would like to thank you for your character Miles Vorkasigen
inspiring me to start writing my books. Miles decided to succeed
despite all obstacles. I am an indie author from Croatia and my
biggest problem is editing books in English because I can't afford
it. My question relates to just that little detail. Do you know
someone who could help me with pro bono editing? With all due

No, I'm afraid I don't. I always got along with crit groups and
writer-friends with whom I traded, and still trade, test-reads.<br>

One does need to learn to edit oneself, because no one else can
really know just what story you're trying to tell, but that's a
lifelong learning process.<br>

iBooks/iTunes and Nook both have it. They and Kindle are the only
three authorized sellers of the e-version of this short novella. I
believe Blackstone's audio edition may be on a few more vendor
sites, and in some libraries.<br>

Subterranean Press is sold out of their limited hardcover; the

I know you're a Star Trek fan from WAY BACK! I am too. I watched
the first episode as it originally aired, with my big brother. So
have you watched Star Trek Discovery? I just watched the first
episode of Season 3 last night and Michael's reaction to the truth
drug sure reminded me of Miles's reaction to the fast-penta given

As so many I am very grateful for your books. Cordelia was
something of a role model for me. Her pragmatism about government,
about God, about life, and about parenting helped shape the way I
view many of those things. I believe I am a better mother, a better
social worker and even a better government employee because of how
you wrote her. I hope there are more Vorkosigan/Barrayar stories to
come?</a></div>

Well, character, setting, and plot are always interlocking, with
feedback loops throughout, so that comes with the fundamental
structure of fiction.<br>
<br>
Tolkien's famous quote about the difference between allegory and
applicability always struck me as cogent. To save y'all the task of
looking it up, it goes, "But I cordially dislike allegory in all
its manifestations, and have always done so ever since I grew old
and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true
or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and
experience of readers. I think many confuse 'applicability' with
'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and
the other in the purposed domination of the author."<br>
<br>
I should be pleased if people find my work applicable.<br>
<br>
(I think this quote also nails the difference in readerly
perception of a story between "human insight" and
"preachiness".)<br>
<br>
Good luck on your writing!<br>
<br>
Ta, L.</span></div>

I'm not sure where you got that population figure, but it wasn't
from me. Too high. Some major cities are that large, though. (Which
isn't that large -- my home urban area is something like 4 million,
iirc.)<br>
<br>
"Current" population of the planet is more than 50 million (that
was its population back at the end of the Time of Isolation), less
than 500 million. Komarr has maybe 1/10 the population of Barrayar.
Sergyar, it's been noted, is up to about 2 million, making
Vicereine Cordelia's administration roughly that of a mid-sized
Midwestern city.<br>

So glad you found and enjoyed all the books!<br>
<br>
Nothing new is planned for the Vorkosigans at this time, although
if you want a somewhat different flavor of Bujold, I'd point you at
my fantasy works. <i>The Spirit Ring</i> is a complete stand-alone.
<i>The Curse of Chalion</i> is probably the best place to start the
World of the Five Gods tales, although the novella "Penric's Demon"
is also a possibility, as it kicks off a sub-series.<br>

<br>
Private questions like these do not belong in my public Q&amp;A
space, although you are not the first frustrated GR user to resort
to it. The way to communicate on GR is first to request to be
friended by the person you are trying to reach, and then to use the
GR internal email system. Turns out you have to be friended first
in order to send a message, which is non-obvious. After being
friended, it should be possible to get the person's GR addy to
populate your intended GR email, and send it.<br>
<br>

I rode horses quite a bit in my youth, but never tried to transport
baggage or weapons while doing so. Military history from the Middle
Ages or antiquity or, for that matter, 19th C. cavalry might help.
All the pictures one sees show the rider holding the spear or lance
upright, often anchored on the stirrup, which seems to me would tie
up a hand; might be OK for immediate deployment, but I don't think
it would do for distance travel. Swords did have saddle-mounted
scabbards.<br>

morning, Ms. Bujold! I'm a huge fan of your writing, thank you! I'm
far from a writer myself, but like many people, I do have to write
some for my job. Most writers say the trick is to just get your
thoughts on paper, then go back later and make them good, which is
pretty much the exact opposite of what I do. Is that how you do it?
And if so, do you think it has affected the way you think and talk
as well?</a></div>

Mm, I get my thoughts on paper, any old how, at the
notes-and-outlines pre-writing stage. Jotted in pencil on lined
paper in a 3-ring binder, which I keep around my house open pretty
much all the time when I'm into a project, ready to capture passing
thoughts. Pencil and paper are, somehow, non-binding, allowing
brainstorming (or brain-drizzling, or brain light-Scotch-misting.)
I think of it as my prosthetic memory on paper, because otherwise
things would all evaporate before I needed to remember them. I also
do a certain amount of shoving things around on paper to get them
into a sensible order.<br>
<br>
When words actually start to flow, it's out of the basis of this
pre-writing. At that stage, I find it enormously easier to do it
right the first time than try to fix it later. I hate doing
revisions because, first, my prose sets up like concrete and takes
a jackhammer to change, and second, I always worry I'm making it
worse not better. (I still revise, mind you, as needed.)<br>
<br>
Note that I do this in succeeding scene-sized chunks, not the whole
at once. By the end of a project, I'll have accumulated about as
many pages of scribbled notes as I have of finished story.<br>
<br>
However, more recently, I'm slipping more and more to wholly
paperless production, a medium in which fixing becomes easier. I do
way more micro-editing when I'm working paperless. (As I have just
spent several minutes doing on this very answer.) I still need my
notes, but they've been getting sketchier.<br>
<br>
So there isn't just one way for even one writer to do things all
the time.<br>

afternoon! (I hope this question hasn't been asked; there's no way
to search "Ask the Author" and you already have 1008 answered
questions!) I've been wondering about the origin of the phrase "No
artificial shortages!" that Uncle/Professor/Lord Auditor Vorthys
likes. Online I found a brief modern use of the phrase on Twitter
(someone talking about socialism), and not much else. Is it a
quote, perhaps? Thank you!</a></div>

Yes, it's a quote -- but from my father, complaining about my
mother's overly frugal grocery buying habits. (Not the only element
of Vorthys inspired by my Dad; engineering failure analyst,
professor, and baggy suits being some others.)<br>
<br>
If my Dad picked it up from anywhere, I would not know, but it
would certainly have been long pre-internet.<br>

You are welcome!<br>
<br>
Miles came from a number of braided sources, but his beginning was
in his parents' story (like everyone else's, I suppose.) Before I'd
finished my first novel, before I knew his name or anything else, I
knew Aral and Cordelia would have a short, disabled son on Barrayar
but, given his parents, he'd probably be quite bright. The energy
and charisma, he generated for himself as his story got
rolling.<br>
<br>
(Young Winston Churchill and T.E. Lawrence were two other sources
that contributed a few more elements, and his Great Man's Son
Syndrome owes some of its insight to my relationship with my own
father.)<br>

Well, nothing <i>is</i> planned at this time. It's the most honest
answer I can give, apart from "No." Which would depress people
unnecessarily, and beside might turn out not to be true if some
random neuron fires in the unforeseen future and presents me with
something that has to be a VK story and nothing else. (One hasn't
fired yet.)<br>

But I'm glad what I wrote in the past is still finding love in the

Well, Turner, Aaronovitch, Pratchett, Wrede, Kingfisher, and Heyer
are all tastes of mine that seem to have crossover for some of my
readers. My "My Books" link, above, has reviews of things I've read
lately.<br>
<br>
For much older influences, Poul Anderson, Eric Frank Russell,
Randall Garrett, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith for sure, and James
H. Schmitz might all be mentioned.<br>
<br>
Not genre fiction, but <i>Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</i>, which I
reviewed somewhere in My Books, was a profoundly excellent fairly
recent read.<br>
<br>
This seems like a game anyone can play -- I'd invite folks to chime
in below in the comments.<br>

You're one of my favorite writers. Might be a silly question (and
answered somewhere way below my scrolling abilities?): both in the
Curse of Chalion and in the Miles series, there is a "love"
triangle between the powerful man (Ias, Aral) and his wife/male
friend. I wonder whether this type of relation is inspired by some
famous historical examples? <a class=

Well, in Chalion, a lot of the family relationships were lifted
directly from 15th. C. Spanish court history, which includes a lot
of gossip about people's love lives, true or not, much as the
internet has. (It does something to one's view of history to
realize that its written sources are just about that unreliable.)
There were a couple of weak kings in there who had overly powerful
and resented lordly supporters, including Orico's model poor King
Enrique IV. Coin flip which members of a royal couple were accused
of adultery, but I'll give you one guess which generated the most
criticism.<br>
<br>
Aral's situation grew more directly out of his own psychology and
the frustrated Betan-ness of his beloved wife.</span></div>

This was 22 years ago, and I can't remember what I had for dinner
last week, but anyway, the idea first floated up back when I was
devising the butterbugs for <i>A Civil Campaign</i> -- what else
could I do with this tech? etc. The way termites reprocess and
recycle their landscapes played into it, and how their gut bacteria
works to break down otherwise indigestible lignin.<br>
<br>
There is also a touch of that fairy tale about how the hero/ine is
aided in a seemingly impossible sorting task of some fine-grained
mixture by friendly ants.<br>
<br>
Also recommended: the PBS Nature episode "Radioactive Wolves".<br>

Would you agree? Up to "The prisoner of Limnos" she was a full part

to do with her now. Although there's still plenty of room for more

Well, Nikys and Penric don't have a problem with what Nikys does
now -- she's fully engaged with her busy life. It's only the
antipathy of the genre to domesticity in general and caregivers in
particular that makes that what she's doing un-story-able.
Producing all the thread and fabric and clothing for her household,
ferex, is pretty interesting to the maker, and perhaps to the
fabric artists in the audience, but it's not what most people tune
in to a fantasy tale for. Nor are the hour-to-hour tasks of keeping
small children from killing themselves. Nor is gestation. Yet
readers automatically expect grownup infants to populate their
stories, dressed, without ever thinking about how they got there
and how much labor it took.<br>
<br>
Pen, between adventures, sitting happily in his study translating
the same book into yet another language, finds it a perfectly
absorbing task to him (tho' Des is getting pretty bored with it)
but it couldn't be a story either.<br>
<br>
Stories happen in the interruptions, I guess. Plenty of room for
them in all sorts of spots in the timeline. Especially if one isn't
writing yet another universe-saving War To End Wars (and the
series.)<br>
<br>
Though giving a woman with nursing infants or small children bolted
to her an adventure turns it into something a lot less fun, more of
a horror story, a genre I don't care to explore at present. Though
arguably, Cordelia and Dubauer in <i>Shards of Honor</i> might
qualify. (Giving such a tale to a woman with older children has
been done from time to time -- readers could probably chime in
below with examples. Wrede's <i>Caught in Crystal</i> comes to
mind. )<br>

in whatever way Lois wants to do it. Characters do change, if the
fiction is any good. I've liked some of Lois' books better than
others, but they're all good. I admire her choice of a middle-aged
woman as adventuring protagonist in Paladin of Souls. Could her
weaving could be part of a story line for Nikys? I'm sure Lois has
plenty of ideas already.</a></div>

Well, ideas come as they come for me, trailing in as single spies
not battalions. I just finished the next Penric tale
<i>yesterday</i> -- see my April 16th blog post for details -- so
there won't be anything else started for a while. I'm looking
forward to a summer off, with some outdoors time...<br>

A third collection on paper is certainly possible, and hoped-for,
but it can't happen till Subterranean Press's really quite short
term of exclusive license for the last story runs out. Which is
"Masquerade in Lodi", probably to be published as a limited
hardcover by SubPress sometime this coming winter. (I've seen the
preliminary cover art.) So no third collection before 2023.<br>
<br>
I have a nice series title ready for it, anyway -- <i>Penric's
Labors</i>.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, all three collections -- <i>Penric's Progress, Penric's
Travels</i> and <i>Penric's Labors</i> -- are available now for
foreign language translation sales. With the novel to join them
soon, for a tidy package.<br>

Yes, although less for current usage than that I turned out to want
the neutral pronoun a decade later much more for the biologically
sexless ba. Well, different planets, different strokes...<br>
<br>
English is <i>desperately</i> in need of a gender-neutral
<i>singular</i> pronoun, and I wish SF back then had evolved some
consensus on one that would have become common coin and leaked out
into the culture at large, so we wouldn't be stuck now with the
repurposed and confusing "they". There were a wide variety of tries
at it, but no compelling uniformity was reached.<br>
<br>
(And while I'm at it, I <i>long</i> for the equivalent of the
Japanese gender-neutral "sensei", meaning a person having mastery
in a skill. Because "mistress" does not mean at all the same thing
as "master", and "master" trails yet other baggage.)<br>
<br>
Bel actually started as futuristic furniture, just something for
Miles to trip over in that first scene back in <i>The Warrior's
Apprentice</i> (written 1984.) But then the herm regained
consciousness, opened its mouth, and started to talk, pretty
instantly becoming a person, and that was that.<br>

characters have to have appeal, or I won't be interested enough to

Longtime fan, thanks to my cousins, who introduced me to Cordelia &
Miles some twenty years ago. As an SF author who's mainly gone the
trad route and only dabbled in self-pub, I'm curious about the
process of self-publishing the Penric novellas vis-a-vis the
traditional publishing route. What's the process like for Penric?
Do you hire editors, copyeditors, etc.? Do you prefer one way over
the other? Thanks!</a></div>

Long years of self-training and self-editing meant it was already
my custom to turn in manuscripts as camera-ready as possible. (I
prefer to get most of my editing in before the story is done,
because I'll be too tired and wired at the finish line to do a good
job.) So I don't hire anyone, relying instead on my circle of test
readers as before; some fellow writers with whom I trade crit, some
old friends whom I just exploit. People drop in or out of this
small circle as per their interest and time.<br>

I publish through my long-time literary agency (I've been with
Spectrum since 1989), who has a tech wizard who does all the
formatting and uploading for me. I could learn how to do that but
I'm glad I don't have to. Spectrum also collates the proceeds and
sends them on in tidy monthly lumps, and handles the subrights
sales -- audio, paper reprints, foreign translation sales. So they
fully earn their 15%.<br>
<br>
In our early outings, said tech wizard and I devised the covers
ourselves, which was a valuable learning experience for us both,
but now that it's clear the ebooks will pay for the outlay, I hire
out the cover art to a pro, also a long-time friend, at his
standard (rather modest) e-cover rate.<br>
<br>
Here in my semi-retirement, the virtues of indie epub, besides the
higher royalty rates and the broad reach and durability of its
market, is for me exactly its independence. I can write what I
want, when I want, and no publisher has to eat the costs of any
failed experiments. I am especially not obliged to perform more PR
than I want to because someone else has bet their money on me. (The
semi- in my retirement is largely from public speaking, book tours,
and convention travel, all a lot more uncomfortable for me than
they used to be.) So I prefer epub <i>now</i>, though trad pub was
certainly excellent in its day.<br>

Nope.<br>
<br>
My recent indie ebooks are available at just 3 vendors, Kindle,
Nook, and Apple Books/iBooks, and none are for free. If you see one
elsewhere, and for free, it's probably pirated.<br>
<br>
(Blackstone, Baen, and HarperCollins reach more vendors, and of
course Baen sells licensed editions through their own website, all
good. Though also not free. They, and I, also have some in
libraries, also legit, and free to the patrons.)<br>

Pen and Des are remarkably compatible, and in Prisoner of Limnos we
saw that Pen can control Des at need, even over her objections. But
there must be times that they are at odds. How do you think they
handle the fact that they just can't get away from each
other?</a></div>

That would be an interesting question to explore in some story
sometime. Did they/will they ever suffer the equivalent of the
7-year-itch? It's more likely to be a problem for Pen than Des, due
to her deep experience and long view. It really is a
till-death-do-us-part issue. If Pen got difficult, Des would likely
be the one to compromise and comport -- for now -- because she'd
know she can wait it out.<br>
<br>
There's also the interesting point that the longer they are
together, the more they will leak into each other. This is obvious
on Des's side, as she takes up Pen's imprint, subtler on Pen's
side. Losing her by this point, for Pen, would be like being
blinded and having several limbs amputated. Rather worse than
having your car break down, suddenly turning from a magic carpet
into an awkward 2000-pound outdoor sculpture.<br>
<br>
But yes, some internal arguments could get pretty amusing.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>(OP was asking
if the novella "The Flowers of Vashnoi" would ever be reprinted on
paper in the UK, to which the short answer was "No".)<br>
<br>
My experiences with British publishing are a long story, or maybe a
horror story, which I have told before, but to recap in brief:<br>
<br>
My first four VK books were sold to Headline for mass-market
paperback in the late 80s by Baen's then-foreign-rights agent, as
in my early book contracts I hadn't kept those rights. Good so far.
(I think the first mistake was not staying with them, but at the
time no one, even me, knew how long the series would go on.) Said
agent got a better advance offer from Pan, to which my original
purchasing editor had moved (I swear British editors should be
fitted with tracking collars) and we switched to them for the next
few books. About the time <i>Mirror Dance</i> was winning my third
novel Hugo, Pan's SF line went under, taking my books with it.<br>
<br>
Third try was Earthlight, a few years later, with whom we tried to
restart the series at <i>Memory</i>. I see they actually got as far
as <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>. Meanwhile, we'd recovered the rights
for the out-of-print books with Headline, three of which
(<i>Shards, Barrayar</i> and <i>Warrior's</i>) we resold to Pan in
hopes of getting some series synergy going. When they didn't appear
after a rather long wait, we made inquiries, to discover 1) the
line was going under and 2) they had <i>forgotten they had bought
the titles</i>. They reluctantly published them at the last gasp
(the undertaker editor tasked with the cover copy had never read
them, with odd effects on same), to minuscule sales. And that was
the end of that.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile I'd started the Chalion books with Harper Collins US, who
treated them and me quite well, so we tried that series on HC UK.
When <i>Paladin of Souls</i> returned disappointing sales, they
declined to pick up <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i>, so that was the end
of that as well. No one ever offered for <i>The Sharing Knife</i>
series.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile yet again, ebooks were at last starting to take off with
the arrival of the Kindle around 2010, which was the big
game-changer. As my literary agent recovered the rights to all the
dead books, in 2011 we gradually got them up as indie ebooks in the
UK, where they have sold modestly but steadily ever since.<br>
<br>
I actually have no idea what current British publishers may think
of my work, as I swore them all off over a decade ago. We gave UK
distribution rights for the two Penric paper collections to Baen,
who may not do better with them in the UK market but certainly
cannot do worse.<br>

Yes, I'm enormously pleased by that cover art. Best depiction of a
character of mine on the cover I've ever had, and an accurate
representation of the story as well. (Although SubPress's cover for
"Knife Children" is also up there.)<br>

Sounds like paranoid fantasy to me. Really, given actual biology,
such is not needed.<br>
<br>
People do tend to be weirdly reassured to imagine that such things
are under some human control, even when they're not. Especially
when they're not, I suspect.<br>

Not sure what this is in reference to, since it's a separate entry
instead of a comment on an earlier question. In any case, you can
likely start with <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>, available on
Kindle, Nook, and Apple Books.<br>
<br>
...Or you might be thinking of Byerly Vorrutyer, who makes his
first appearance in <i>A Civil Campaign</i>, sequel to
<i>Komarr</i>. I rec starting the pair with <i>Komarr</i>, for
continuity, tho' By isn't in it.<br>

There is more than one kind of published author, and thus more than
one answer with respect to the details, but, "Write it. Finish it."

What difference it would make would depend on the particulars of
the human (though not of the demon-elemental-blob, which would be
identical in every case.) It might feel less like going mad to the
untrained recipient, as there wouldn't be all those confusing
animal lives/perceptions/memories to deal with, but it would still
feel decidedly odd. (Not to mention carcinogenic, plus the new
accident-prone-ness.)<br>

Nope. Not a peep. Alas, it's not up to me. Media is a buyer's
market, and the buyers are the <i>producers</i>, the folks with
money, other people's or their own -- or both, given the high costs
of production.<br>
<br>
I suspect few of them are Bujold readers.<br>
<br>
Adapting my material also has a hidden hazard in its interiority
--a lot of what readers enjoy is actually taking place inside the
characters' heads, where the camera cannot go, or in the stylistic
voice (which are mostly one and the same, in my choice of tight
viewpoint.) It's the great strength of prose fiction, so I play to
it hard, but removing that whole layer for visual media would cost
a lot of depth.<br>

The 5GU is not our world, so I can have them eating potatoes if I
want, I just haven't so far. I have so far also resisted "mahogany"
for the typical skin color of Cedonians, although it's the perfect
term. So my "great green bird" is probably some sort of parrot.<br>
<br>
A dog-fox is actually an our-world term; it just means a male fox.
As contrasted with a vixen, a female fox.<br>
<br>
The sex, not the species, of the animal is usually matched with the
supposed gender of the god/ess. So one might well have a male gray
parrot for the Father sometime. Color coded where possible -- if
they can obtain something close or evocative.<br>
<br>
And if the local temple can't afford those fancy flourishes, five
kittens with different colored ribbons around their necks can also
do the job. It's apparent from the results that the gods aren't
fussy.<br>

book rec, by asking if you've read "The Domestic Revolution: How
the Introduction of Coal into Victorian Homes Changed Everything"

cooked. I hadn't realized how different life built around wood
combustion was, compared to all the things that had to be
introduced as homes shifted to coal. Also touches on domestic

(I am American he is German) they found that the Lakewalkers
invoked an image of Gypsies rather than Native Americans. In most

noticed TSK was only translated up to book three in German. Was the

My books have not sold well in German. But it's also possible the
publisher never noticed it was 4 books, not the expected trilogy --
that happened with the Russian edition. I believe we did eventually
catch up with them and get the 4th through, but I didn't know about
Germany. Urgh, but too late now, as the books are out of print and
out of license.<br>
<br>
I really don't think many of my foreign publishers pay much
attention to my work...<br>
<br>
But no, gypsies weren't in my stock of (several) inspirations for
the Lakewalkers.<br>

one of the oldest roots, oddly, was from a climactic scene from the
old British comedy <i>The Horse's Mouth</i>, in which... is it

hastily thrown over the floor to conceal a large hole, and...

Some, in WWI analyses and the like historical examinations. Stuff
on the Dunning-Kruger effect (smart people underestimating
themselves, non-smart people overestimating) has been kicking
around for a while, but that's rather different.<br>
<br>
I understand the use of repurposing of standard English words into
specific other meanings for the purpose of precise argument, which
he does here, but it irritates me, as it seems more likely to lead
to misunderstanding than the intended reverse. Otherwise, yes, I
get what he's trying to say and somewhat agree.<br>
<br>
My own related observation, which does dovetail with the article,
is that stupid (in the original meaning) people fool themselves in
stupid ways, and smart people fool themselves in smart ways.
Examples of the latter may be found in dead-end scientific theories
-- all those complex calculations for epicycles of planetary motion
were not done by stupid people -- and high-end theology --
Scholasticism makes an interesting study of enormous amounts of
brainpower wasted on systematic rubbish. The biggest problem with
the latter category is how hard it is for anyone else to combat,
since it will certainly <i>look</i> convincing.<br>

In the near future, no. I am presently taken up with other creative
interests.<br>
<br>
"Ever" (or "never") is not something I can answer, as story ideas
strong enough to grip me trickle in somewhat randomly and
unexpectedly. I don't have schedules or contracts anymore,
thankfully, so it only depends on my energy level, and conceiving
something interesting enough to overcome the temptations of yet
more rounds of mindless tablet games. (Which remind me of that old
line, "Hard work pays off in the future, but laziness pays off
right now...!")<br>

My condolences on your loss, but I'm glad you found and enjoyed
<i>The Sharing Knife</i>.<br>
<br>
Fan mail is best sent email. Since you are on Goodreads, the
Goodreads messaging system would be best. It is non-obvious how to
use it, but other posters may be able to help, or there may be a
tutorial somewhere around here.<br>

No "box" sets planned for ebooks, but really, Amazon has already
done this -- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=

You just have to click on the series link (in rather tiny print,
admittedly) toward the top of the book descriptions on the vendor
page.<br>
<br>
(Though I see, looking at the Amazon page just now, that <i>Borders
of Infinity</i> is missing from the list -- it's actually a 17-book
series. Getting corrections out of the Amazon bots is like pushing
pudding uphill, so we may not be able to fix this, but I'll bring
it to someone's attention.)<br>
<br>
Not sure what Nook and Apple Books offer in terms of cross-linkage;
someone who uses them may chime in down in the comments.<br>
<br>
In addition, my reading-order guide, including the (complete)
chronological-order list, appears in the back of every. single.
copy of every. single. title of ALL my indie-published ebooks. I
have no idea why or how so many people (not just you) are managing
not to find it. We've also recently put the "other books by" up in
the front matter, so people hitting the "Look Inside" function will
come across it right away.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps --<br>

My print publisher for the Vorkosigan Series remains Baen Books,
who have faithfully (if sometimes intermittently) kept them in
print since 1986.<br>
<br>
There have been lots of editions and different cover iterations
over that stretch of time. The most recent that comes closest to
what you want (including larger print) are their trade paperback
reprints, but I'm not sure that list was ever completed. (Though
the more recent titles have included going through a trade
paperback morph between the hardcover and the mass-market
paperbacks, so all the 17 titles may in fact all be covered out
there in trade paperback.)<br>
<br>
...Aaand I was going to link a sample, but I see that edition is
out of print, defeating my own remark -- <a target="_blank" rel=
"noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Apprentice-30th-Anniversary-Vorkosigan/dp/1476781303">
https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Appre...</a><br>
<br>
But there's a problem of scale for all publishers with paper
reprints. Basically, they can seldom sell enough copies of newly
printed old (aka "backlist") books to pay for the effort,
especially with cheap used copies of the older titles being so easy
to find on the internet these days. About the only time one would
see that occur is with a very popular series that has a new
("frontlist") book coming out, to which the older titles can be
attached.<br>
<br>
Remember, a publisher's paying customers for paper books aren't
readers, they are bookstores and chains, wholesalers, and other
vendors. Those folks are the ones who have to decide whether to buy
a book, and they must do so before any end user ever gets a chance
to see it in a store. They don't want to lose money and go out of
business either, so they mainly filter for salability.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(Heh, and now I'm reminded of my own experimental foray into
print-on-demand for a fresh trade paperback edition <i>The Spirit
Ring</i>. When I posted the news, the <i>very first</i> comment
anyone made on it was a guy complaining about the price and telling
everyone they could get a used copy cheaper.)</span></div>

A frequently asked question. Frequent answer: nothing planned,
nothing in progress, nothing ruled out.<br>
<br>
If you are ambidextrous to fantasy, I have quite a few more works
of mine I could point you to, but if you're here you presumably
already know about them. In your own time, as they used to say to
cannoneers taking aim.<br>
<br>
But it's always nice to hear my books are still finding new readers
so far into their lifespans!<br>

Ari-SAY-dia is correct, or at least the way I pronounce it. (Also

Q, but I want to say thank you for creating Penric. He’s proof that
characters who are kind and compassionate can also be complex and
riveting to read. His grief over losing a mother (and mother
figure?) and his emotional scarring from physician fatigue feels
very real. The conversation between him and Nikys at the temple in
Penric’s Mission is one of my fave scenes (and the one with Chio at

Thank you!<br>
<br>
I actually consider Penric to be a pretty normal human being, well,
apart from his profession. I'm not sure what it says about our
current fiction that he stands out... (There's that line in
<i>Thasalon</i>, "Normal people carrying on with unthinking
kindness must be as shocking as sudden sunlight to such
dark-adapted eyes..." We may have been reading in the dark for a
little too long.)<br>

Nope.<br>
<br>
It was likely highly planned to some scientific aesthetic, and,
like Athos, veered away from the founders' original visions over
time. Real-world example over a similar number of centuries: the
Bay Colony vs. 21st C. Boston. I doubt many of the pilgrims could
have pictured it, even with 1600s European cities as a model.<br>

Glad you like the names! They are always a challenge for me.<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Thanks for the
kind words! Answering the second question first, another Penric
novella. I hope to get it done and up in another month or so.
(We're talking about late 2021, here.)<br>
<br>
For the first question, that will change with every reader, and
with the same reader over time. But for me, what makes books
rereadable are characters that for one reason or another I have
come to care a lot about, and so want to be with again. Plot is
more of a once-and-done thing.<br>

made the cause something more science fictional in case I needed to

respect that authors must follow their muse. Contradictorily, I

shorter stories like the Penric work. One thought as I’m rereading

how Bel is doing after his experience in Diplomatic Immunity and

"WRT my previous question, my deepest apologies if it’s offensive.
It just reflected two things I’m curious about? I think your work
is amazing. I read excessively and have found no one that equals
you in character development." Pasted together here because GR
separates posts randomly.<br>
<br>
To answer the second part first, not offensive, just common. Among
the most frequently asked fan questions are some variations of,
"Can I get more of whatever character/situation intrigued me in X
story?"<br>
<br>
If people are still thinking about my stories after they finish
reading, it's a good sign I've done my job well for them.
Nonetheless, I can't give a promising answer, especially not to
<i>all</i> of them. (There have to be hundreds by now!)<br>
<br>
There are interesting time/shift issues going on underneath, as
well. People who are just stumbling across my work for the first
time recently (bless them) are getting stories that came out of my
head over the span of decades, all piled up at once. I'm not the
same writer (or person) I was ten, twenty, thirty, or now almost
forty years ago (and a good thing too); I had different
psychological concerns to explore at all those times, and so
different ones now. (As some readers who were taken aback by
<i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i> have cause to know, and
even that is, in the initial conception and writing, almost a
decade old.)<br>
<br>
Which is a long way around to say (tl;dnr) "Nope." And also never
certain, because who knows what ideas will suddenly interest me in
a month, a year, or more. (Though not a week, as I just finished a
novella.) But it seems more likely to be something new than
something old.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(Bel is doing fine, btw. That's one herm who knows how to land
on... well, not its feet in this case, but something
better.)<br></span></div>

"/questions/2247401-does-the-duchy-of-orbas-correspond-to-a">Does
the Duchy of Orbas correspond to a specific real-world place? I
have asssumed it to be vaguely based on the various Balkan
countries, positioned as it is to the south of Cedonia, which
appears to be based on Greece (in your inverted version of Europe).
Do you have a more specific inspiration for Orbas? And ditto for
the city of Vilnoc?</a></div>

geography is inspired by but by no means identical to our-world,
but I frequently use our world the way an artist uses reference

caution... Orbas would be in the western Balkans, on the Adriatic
coast; Croatia roughly. (That "roughly" matters.)<br>
<br>
Vilnoc follows more-or-less logically, drawn somewhat freehand and
from what I've learned about assorted ancient and medieval
Mediterranean cities.<br>

Yes: Cordelia thought it was just fine, as long as due emotional
care was taken; Aral fretted, and had to be Betanly reassured.
Which made him roll his eyes -- Betans! -- and then calm down.
Which was Cordelia's intent.<br>
<br>
(I observe that Betans' long lives would tend to make them less
finicky about age differences than our current oddly obsessed
fashion is.)<br>
<br>
And Jole was quite thoroughly a grownup himself by that point, late
20s. A senior lieutenant considered responsible enough to be put in
operational charge of weaponry that could devastate a planet, as
his prior post's duties included, can probably be trusted run his
own personal life. (And the romancing was mutual, if cautious, like
two porcupines trying to date.)<br>
<br>
Note that Aral was out of the military at that point, a civilian,
so did not think of Jole being his subordinate in the same sense as
when he was Regent and commander-in-chief. This got upwhacked
during the Hegen Hub crisis, of course, in all kinds of interesting
ways that Miles didn't see. Very politically dicey period, in ways
that totally eclipsed any personal concerns; Aral's worst
nightmares coming in waves.<br>

No, those are our only three platforms for ebooks. Given their free
apps, they should be available for whatever device you are reading
this on, though Nook does not distribute outside N. America. The
Blackstone audio editions, however, appear more widely, including
in some libraries.<br>
<br>
The two, eventually three, Penric collections are also available in
the Baen e-bookstore, as a limited exclusive, and I think they do a
few more formats. It will be a while till Baen can work around to
the newer titles in a collection, though, because Subterranean
Press has first dibs for their signed limited editions.
(<i>Penric's Labors</i> is tentatively projected for paper
publication in December of 2022.)<br>

I don't do that anymore, for a bunch of practical reasons,
including not wanting to drag myself to the post office or shipping
store, and not least the chances of parcels being lost en
route.<br>
<br>
HowEVER, Uncle Hugo's Science Fiction Bookstore or Dreamhaven Books
& Comics here in Minneapolis can sell and ship signed new books,
personalized by request. No added charge or delay for the sigs,
though there might be a bit of a wait on personalizations. (Which
means folks thinking of Christmas right now (this is Nov. 14th) may
want to build in lead-time.)<br>

Every time I reread Cetaganda I pause at the part where Miles says
bitterly, “It is the way of the haut” and she gives him a lock of
her hair. Did I miss a whole lot of nuance, or did an editor cut a
lot? Up until she gives him the bubble ride I thought she didn’t
like him, considered him a creepy though smart and useful stalker.
The atmosphere changes a bit then, but not that much. <a class=

nothing missing or mislaid in that passage. Definitely no

What they were doing before their marriages I don't know, but
after, Olivia would have had a full-time job as Countess Vorrutyer,
and Delia, who could be an understudy for Alys by temperament, also
would become a political hostess/mover-and-shaker.<br>

Miles does remark somewhere that a countess is in effect an
assistant count, though the role is rather freeform, even more so
now post-uterine-replicator technology -- counts wear a lot of hats
in terms of their duties, and have to delegate if they are to do
right by their Districts.<br>

Hm, this is probably a comment on a prior question. Understandable
in this instance, though.<br>
<br>
Note that Goodreads separates questions, often randomly, so if you
want something to appear with whatever it is commenting upon
instead of bobbing around loose and mysterious, it needs to go down
in the comments section of the answer given.<br>

Interesting idea, though I'm afraid the 5's minds are much too
large to encompass. They're not like the Greek or Norse or even
Chinese gods, humans writ large; they are genuinely ineffable,
alien even though profoundly part of the world. The visions
characters occasionally have of them are human-sized-and-seeming
just because that's all the human mind can encompass, like a
millimeter leak from a municipal water tower. (Or more accurately
as a millimeter leak as experienced from inside a submarine.) Which
is also why every vision is subtly different, each shaped by the
shape of the mind receiving it. Of all the visions that have turned
up in the stories so far, Cazaril's of the Daughter at the end of
<i>Chalion</i> came the closest to seeing a god entire, and that
nearly broke him, and certainly effected permanent changes in and
upon him. A little bit joyously mad thereafter, and inclined to
emitting William-Blake-level poetry at random times. (Saint Umegat
would make a whole 'nother study.)<br>

Welcome!<br>
<br>
That answer will vary depending on the tastes and interests of the
reader. <i>The Curse of Chalion</i> is my usual starter-rec for
fantasy readers, so you're good to go there. Dive in.<br>
<br>
The science fiction side is trickier. If you like to read your
series in strict order, <i>Shards of Honor</i> is first in the
Vorkosigan series in chronological, publication, and writing order,
and also my first novel. If you prefer a young male protagonist,
<i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>, another early and early-series
book, also works, or <i>The Borders of Infinity</i> novella
collection for a sampler platter, though I really feel that would
work better after tWA.<br>
<br>
Start the recent Penric & Desdemona novella series with the
e-novella "Penric's Demon" or its first paper collection
<i>Penric's Progress</i>.<br>
<br>
Note that while <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> is set in the same fantasy
world, it does not follow on from the first two, <i>Chalion</i> and
its direct sequel <i>Paladin of Souls</i> but is rather a
stand-alone set 200 years earlier in another realm and with a
completely different cast of characters. If you know that going in,
you won't waste time flailing around either waiting for it to turn
into a continuation or peeved that it doesn't. It does lay in some
worldbuilding useful for the later "Penric and the Shaman"
novella.<br>
<br>
Happy reading!<br>
<br>

Not consciously. But I was pleased by the serendipity, when I
noticed it.<br>
<br>
Divine and therefore theologian does follow in lockstep to becoming
a trained Temple sorcerer. Physician was a less-standard bonus. Pen
will likely duck lawyering.<br>
<br>
The original term "doctor", which dates back to the medieval
university system, actually means "teacher", not "physician". (No
one will have noticed that I never use the term doctor for 5GU
medicos.) A doctorate was actually a license to teach in any
Church-accredited institution throughout Europe. An oath-sworn
Temple divine has something of the same status, someone to be
trusted with teaching.<br>

I've actually read very little Bronte (just <i>Jane Eyre</i>) and
not that one, so no, it wasn't an influence. Ekaterin and Miles's
tale came from a wide range of seeds, including real life
experiences that won't be available to people tracking literary
sources. But Heyer, Sayers, Austen, and Shakespeare are also all in
the work's family tree somewhere, to be sure, in the oblique way
that such a piled-up compost heap of ideas work out.<br>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Writers have
all kinds of systems, variously elaborate. I don't have much. By
the time I've written a book, I've read it over so many times it's
nearly ingrained, although I notice that now that I have a longer
past, more early work is fading out. If it's written and published,
I can look it up in the story, or nowadays search text if the
question lends itself to keywords. In a pinch, I can ask my fans on
my blog or chat list if anyone remembers the detail in question, on
the confident theory that among them all, someone will have reread
it more recently than I have.<br>
<br>
Anything not published can be changed, or changed around, to fit
the current story's needs. It's seldom wrong to have a better idea,
if it can be sneaked in. So no, I don't have a 30-volume
Encyclopedia Barrayarica secreted in my garage, slowly molding. I
made it up once; I can make it up, or at least boot it up, again,
although my innate laziness prefers not to if looking it up is
easier. I do sometimes reread when working out a new story, to
prime the pump and refill the well.<br>
<br>
Rereads also come in the way of business when a new edition needs
proofread, an exercise of incredible tedium that I have had
occasion to regret skipping, so there's that periodic
reinforcement. (A subset of Don't Trust Anyone.)<br>
<br>
Now, I've regretted my lack of system more than once, particularly
as the lists of made-up names grow unwieldy. And proper publishers
like to have written lists of all the neologisms and usages for
their copy editors to refer to, so keeping one as you go along,
saving devising it later in a hurry, is a good idea. Also speaking
from experiences to be avoided.<br>
<br>
"When in doubt, check it" usually works. Problem comes when one is
not in doubt but nonetheless wrong, oops.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

I usually toss in Ben Aaronovitch and Megan Whalen Turner when
asked this, for recent writers, though really neither are that
recent anymore. If you look at the top of this page for my "My
Books", there are reviews of quite a lot of things I've read since
taking up Goodreads, some recced, some not. I don't review
everything I read, and I don't review anything I don't finish or
don't like (much the same, these days) and I usually only cover the
first of a series.<br>
<br>
I presume you've found my other two series, the Vorkosigan Saga and
The Sharing Knife tetralogy?<br>

Please do not use the Author Q&amp;A feature to try to ask private
questions. They cannot be answered privately.<br>
<br>
Use the Goodreads private messaging system instead -- that's what
it's for. To be found under the little envelope icon, I believe. I
have recently reset (I hope) my GR email to public instead of
limited to GR-accepted friends, so any GR member should be able to
use it. In theory. Unless I'm misunderstanding the system, which
happens.<br>
<br>
(If the questioner has not also set their GR email to public, or
possibly been friended by/friended me, not sure, I can't message
them in reply either.)<br>
<br>
Anyone who actually has used the system is invited to chime in down
in the comments to explain how in more detail. The method is
non-obvious, unfortunately.<br>

Well, my tale first tripped (literally) over Bel in 1983, supposed
to have been a throw-away bit of world-building, scene setting not
a speaking or an ongoing character. If I had known, etc. I most
regret the use of "it" then because the pronoun would have been far
more useful later when my genuinely sexless ba came onto the
scene.<br>
<br>
The English language is desperately in need of an unambiguous
gender-neutral singular pronoun, and if science fiction as a genre
had picked one ("zie" ferex), instead fielding a competing dozen,
and agreed upon it decades ago as common coin, it might have leaked
into the wider culture by now and the problem would be solved,
sigh. If I'd given Bel a different pronoun, it would have been one
of these or one of my own coinage, certainly not the repurposed
plural.<br>
<br>
Updating is a problem with multiple pitfalls. First of course is
that "current standards" are a moving target that change about
every ten or even five years. Any writers engaging in reediting a
large body of work to keep up would soon find themselves doing
nothing else.<br>
<br>
A subtler problem is that, in a very real sense, those long-ago
books were written by someone else. Not only am I a different
person mentally by now, in 20 years, they say, even one's bones
completely replace themselves. To what extent should I have a right
to alter that other person's words, to retcon the past, to
photoshop that snapshot of history?<br>
<br>
Which also leads me to the musing of whether a story is more like
an artifact or a person, a philosophical question that would
require a lot more tea than I've drunk yet this morning to
address.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>

(Betan herms, I should probably say again, are not intersexed. They
are an artificially bioengineered future sex that does not exist on
Earth today. I suspect this fine point of biology slips past many
readers.)<br></span></div>

The work would have to be licensed by a media production company,
one that has the money, know-how, and clout to make such. (I'd love
a mini-series for any of my books; feature-length movies have to
leave too much out.) It's very much a buyer's market, however,
since books are many and media producers are few.<br>
<br>
No media company has offered for it yet. Such an event is not ruled
out, but it's not up to me.<br>

Congrats on having a very bright young reader!<br>

I'm very fond of By myself.<br>
<br>
By's father suffered from being Ges Vorrutyer's younger brother,
and was likely molested and certainly tormented by him in various
proto-nasty ways when young. This more than anything predisposed
him to be suspicious of older brothers, with knock-on effects on
poor By. I don't think it would have needed Richars's input, though
the latter is not ruled out. (Neither is it made up at this
time.)<br>

Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Heh. That's one
of those many pernicious "writing rules" that aren't. Pat Wrede in
her excellent writing blog has a number of tart things to say about
dictums of that ilk. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"
href="https://pcwrede.com/blog/">https://pcwrede.com/blog/</a> "In
danger" is more of a moving target. The character needs a problem
that strongly matters, but it need not be life-threatening to do
so. (See "Knot of Shadows" ferex.)<br>
<br>
That said, when such a death was integral the story, it was the
story, and I don't argue with the story... well, I don't win,
anyway. Two disparate examples (spoilers follow):<br>
<br>
My generation of what became <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>
actually <i>began</i> with a vision of the death of Bothari, under
rather different circumstances than what finally evolved, but that
was inherent from the get-go. I'm not sure to what extent he
qualifies as "likeable", to be sure. The death of Teidez in <i>The
Curse of Chalion</i> was likewise baked into the plot from the
beginning.<br>
<br>
The death of Aral was something I'd edged up to, and avoided, for
years, and it finally took an entire book to get its thematic and
emotional work done, both for me and for Miles. That one was likely
the hardest.<br>
<br>
I recall one review, years ago, where the reviewer complained that
he "wasn't going to take my work seriously" unless I killed off
Ivan. I decided that was his problem, not mine. Violence is not the
only kind of action, and mortal stakes are not the only ones that
matter. As always, in writing as in life "It Depends."<br>

Pretender's War, through to increasing mutual respect as they each
grow into their new jobs, to secret hopeless silent but not
mutually unaware pining in the later years. To, with the chip
removal and Simon's retirement, the glorious freedom that we see
glimpses of thereafter in the books. So: not realization, but
opportunity at last.<br>

I've missed something fairly recently, but will there be a 3rd
Penric omnibus soon? And is the signed Subterranean Press edition
of "Assassins" the only one likely to come out? I much prefer

A flimsy is essentially plastic paper. So, folded over, holds
things like any other envelope. I picture being able to put old
flimsy sheets in some hopper in the flimsy printer to be melted

Early work, and I don't remember what all I intended. I suppose
there could have been an uncle on one side or the other also caught
up in the general deadly sweep, possibly Padma's father i.e.
Sonia's husband. It was an extended family gathering, after all,
plus the death squads struck elsewhere at the same time. Final
version is mother, brother, and sister there at the time for
sure.<br>

WA, only my 2nd novel written, pretty much presented itself through
Miles's eyes from the get-go. (My first venture into multiple
viewpoint was <i>Falling Free</i>, written 4th.) So, no; though if
readers find themselves thinking about the other characters'
viewpoints, it's a good sign they're getting through the
single-viewpoint character's filters (in some cases, blinders)
well. I didn't experiment with dual viewpoint till irrc my 10th
novel, <i>The Spirit Ring</i>.<br>

again! I have a question about Ivan. I seem to recall reading
somewhere that your characters had quite decided personalities and
so writing with them was an adventure, not always what you
expected. Did you always know that Ivan was quite bright, even when
he seemed to be Ivan-you-idiot? Or did he grow into that as he
matured? I liked him very much by the later books, but not as much
in the beginning. TY :)</a></div>

Ivan always had capacity, but he really was pretty feckless and
thoughtless as a youngster and teen. He earned his moniker through
a string of boneheaded gaffes, misadventures, and remarks, not
recounted. (Nor made up by me in detail, so don't ask, but his
nearest and dearest witnessed and remembered, to his later
annoyance.) But, like the more fortunate among us, he survived and
learned better over time. By 25, he was much improved, and by 35
hardly off-putting at all.<br>
<br>
He also, of course, grew in the writing, as did all the ongoing
series characters. When he first stumbled onto my page in 1984 in
my second-ever book (WA) he was mainly a foil for Miles, though
already with his own voice. When the chance to reuse him came up in
my fifth, <i>Brothers in Arms</i> he had not only the in-story time
but also the page space to develop.<br>

hints that Alys and Simon *might* consider getting married at some

In order to answer this question and the following -- which is
going to get separated btw -- I would have to stop and <i>make
stuff up</i>. Which I am disinclined to do just at the moment.
Perfectly reasonable question, mind, and I'm pleased that the
characters seem real enough to you that you're still thinking about
them after the book is closed, but working through the many
possibilities seems more a task for the ficcers, who routinely work
in multiverses.<br>

Now, huge caveat here – I am just interested in how things are at
the end of CVA. If it should happen that you are inspired to write
more about them, events could come up could set a different
direction (as it happens in real life). I am just asking here, what
Simon and Alys are thinking/feeling at the end of CVA – not looking
for predictions about the future. Hope that makes sense? Thank you

Me making up what Simon and Alys are thinking at that point would
be tantamount to committing to a future direction, I think. Many
are the possibilities, and I'm not interested in either exploring
or cutting them off just at the moment. So you're still free to
imagine for yourself...<br>

No idea. Look on the map and see if there's another large city
mentioned -- that would be the best bet. On a river, or in the more
populated south. (Somewhere in the farmer-heavy south, not touched
on in the tale, seems likely. The map only includes places named in
the story, for reader orientation, not all possible places.)<br>
<br>
There are also still old coins floating around from lost cities of
the past.<br>

further west (toward the Mississippi and south a ways); it's not

I never worked out all seven, but Oleana centers on Ohio and
surroundings, Raintree on western Indiana and Illinois to the
Mississippi, Seagate is New England (which does have snow-topped
mountains) and eastern-seaboard Canada, Luthlia indeed Minnesota
and S. Canada. Not the Dakotas, they're too far west and still
recovering from the Big Blight. The south presumably has a name or
two for its regions (which would include Graymouth.) I don't
believe I ever named all the hinterlands -- it's useful to leave
some things undefined to give space for future tales.<br>
<br>
The larger map included in the books is as good as it gets for
defined geography, though I rearranged it freely when I needed to.
The Hardboil was the Tennessee River, roughly, though it's been a
while.<br>

Yes; part of the exploration of the series is how to carry on
somehow when your world and your history hands you nothing but bad
choices. Triage all the way down. (And I expect Aral is not nearly
as admiring of his moral center as some outside observers, as he
knows just how much of a bloody mess it really is in this triage
tent.)<br>
<br>
<i>Falling Free</i> is a spaceship that has sailed, I'm afraid.
<i>Diplomatic Immunity</i> allowed me to get in some closure for
the tale, though, a century or two late.<br>

I think that was Elena, when she was explaining opting out of the

I kept a journal and added quotes from your books that resonated
with me. I don't know which book two came from: #2 - This one has
been almost a mantra for me … and one of the reasons I started a
Ph.D. in 2000 at age 50. Miles’ mother: "I want something(s) to
look forward to so the decaying body is ignored in the excitement
of the other.” Is that right? (First showed up in one of my

Lois: a miserable failure on trying to be helpful! I thought the
ellipses at the end of the first sentence were odd - maybe a
missing word? - and had difficulty with the second sentence but, if
you're happy, then that's OK. Thanks for the polite reply to my

https://www.goodreads.com/questions/2...</a><br>
<br>
(It's always best to put comments on a question in its attendant
comment space, or they'll be separated.)<br>
<br>
The ellipsis was, as is usual in my and much fiction, and indicator
of a trailing off without completion, or a pause in either a
speaker's speech or thought-stream, so I don't have to keep putting
the clarifying interruptions in stage business -- "Yadda, hadda,"
he hesitated, "yadda." The hesitations can be for lots of reasons,
usually for the speaker/thinker to select the right word, sometimes
to read the room, other things in context.<br>
<br>
In <i>formal essay and report writing</i>, ellipses are also used
to indicate words edited out of material in a quotation -- Yadda
yadda ... yadda. Where the missing bits can be either a few words
or many sentences.<br>
<br>
The first use is more in the nature of a stage direction. The
second use is scholarly etiquette. If you've been trained in essay
writing, it might be easy to conflate or confuse the two very
different functions of this handy punctuation device.<br>
<br>
As another general rule of how people read, if something in the
writing has confused or discombobulated readers, they are more
likely to stumble over whatever comes next, being already dizzied
-- even if it's perfectly fine, because their flow-of-attention
will be divided between that and whatever they're still chewing
over. Sort of a knock-on effect. Which also happens at more macro
levels than just sentences, alas.<br>

have in the past mentioned that you often decide the theme of a
book by asking yourself, what is the worst possible thing I can do
to my main character and how will they react. I can see that in
your writing but it also seems to me that an underlying theme of
most of your books is that damaged people are drawn to damaged
people. Or might it be rather that damage people might be more
interesting to write?</a></div>

the "worst possible thing" would pertain to the plot, not the
theme. The theme is an emergent property of the story as a whole,
an after-the-fact perception. But anyway.<br>
<br>
I've tried to correct this misquote/misunderstanding before, but
never seem to catch up. What I was trying to get at in the original
exchange was that what happens in a story is most satisfactory for
me when it most deeply reveals a character's character. It's not
meant to be an invitation to authorial sadism. So it would be much
better expressed as "What is the most <i>revealing</i> thing I can
do to my character/s?"<br>
<br>
I actually think that almost all real people are damaged, merely
some less visibly than others. It accumulates with age and
experience. So I fondly imagine that I'm just writing about people
being people. The damage comes along for the ride.<br>
<br>
(There was a particularly wonderful line from <i>Good Omens</i> on
that subject: "... most of the great triumphs and tragedies of
history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or
fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people." )<br>

rereading Penric and the Fox, the first scene kinda of made me

me wonder about it. Fishing for these two set of characters seemed
to be the perfect excuse to drink cold alcoholic beverage under the

where it comes from ? Personnal experience, inside joke, writer's

with brief periods of intense action. That reminds me of a saying
about the military, amusingly enough. At any rate, all of that
sitting around waiting for a fish to bite lends itself well to
hanging out with people (my wife doesn't like fishing or boating in
general, but my brother-in-law and his wife and 3 kids often go out
with me and my 4 kids) or alcohol (in our group, only on the rare
occasions when it is men-only) to help the time pass.<br>

If you're not catching anything there's a good chance you don't
have the right equipment, which makes the "tedious enterprise" (as
@Brzk described it) a whole lot more satisfying.<br>

I've answered this before at greater length, somewhere, if you
scroll back through the pile, but I'm in-between. I do a lot of
general note taking, and pushing ideas around on paper to see if
they'll fit, before I start writing, but it's as much a memory aid
as anything. I then narrow down on scenes, my basic work unit, and
outline each one quite a bit before I sit down and write it out,
sometimes mutating as it goes. Then lather, rinse, repeat with the
next scenes in a chain. I don't outline in detail in advance;
future developments fade off into obscurity pretty quickly, until I
work my way closer.<br>
<br>
I have more problems with characters sitting down and not moving
than with them running off.<br>
<br>
When I'm writing anything at all, that is.<br>

I don't know if any Vorhartungs still exist or not. Anyway, the
Castle is Imperial property and has been for quite some time,
probably since some war in the Bloody Centuries. The name just
lingers, the way such do.<br>

Textev never says outright, but the facts of their shown tech level
implies they are certainly not below galactic standard in health
care including basic genetic tweaking against gene-based disorders
or deficits; and for those who use replicators, any fresh
mutational accidents that happen during the chromosome do-si-do of
fertilization as well. Cosmetic changes, hm. Basic ones probably
allowed, but there might be a borderline at which such measures
might start to impinge on the haut monopoly of the superpersons
project. The haut would always stay a couple of generations ahead
in any case.<br>
<br>
Advanced tech levels pretty much have to be supported bottom-up,
even if partially directed top-down, just to have the necessary
educated people to do All. That. Work. At which point such persons
will also be taking care of themselves and their own. The average
Cetagandans probably find their 8 planets pretty nice places to
live, and brush up against the secretive haut very seldom. The ghem
would be more visible.<br>
<br>
Real population sizes not addressed, but nowhere is as dense as Old
Earth yet. Then or now.<br>

I have no information on Galeni's mom, sorry. Possibilities range
from her dying young, to still being around but estranged, by
politics or just by distance or remarriage and/or emotional
withdrawal from the old pain of her first marriage and all it
brought with it. Or just by physical distance, of which there is a
lot. People do grow away from each other -- here on Old Earth,
emigration often meant never expecting to see one's birth family
again in one's lifetime, and galactic travel times are not unlike
old sea ones.<br>

as if it would be best answered in the comments, since it already
covers my work. Go for it, folks...<br>
<br>
Curiously, I find my reread pile goes in and out of fashion for me;
things I thought I'd never tire of go stale, others rise to the
surface again after years. Best shorthand I can think of for this
effect is that my psychological needs change over time, as do,
sometimes, the reasons I reread what turns out to be no longer
quite the same book.<br>
<br>
I'm glad my work holds up for you. Judging from reviews the book of
mine that most changes its effect on subsequent readings is <i>The
Hallowed Hunt</i>; possibly because readers stop fighting
preconceptions created by other books in the series and the
expectations of the genre generally, and start to take it on its
own terms.<br>

Vast cities are described; who do you think lives there?! Not to
mention who built all that. And does all the other everyday work
that keeps a high-tech society running, much of which is not very

I have an old and close circle of friends with whom I still trade
test-reads or critique of my work in progress, some writers, some
just very good readers. I have had a long history of crit groups
over the decades, changing as my needs or location has; it all
pretty much goes by email nowadays, so geographical proximity is no
longer an issue.<br>
<br>
My indie-published works do not have a publisher or editor, it's
all do-it-myself here in my semi-retirement. I figure if I don't
know what I'm doing by now, it is probably Too Late. But my
professional editors were very valuable to me in my earlier years,
and helped build up the foundation I now rest upon.<br>
<br>
A very good source for level-headed writing advice is Patricia C.
Wrede's blog at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://pcwrede.com/blog/">https://pcwrede.com/blog/</a> Aspiring
writers could start at the beginning and read it all, or use the
search function to narrow in on topics of interest.<br>
<br>
Her ebook <i>Wrede on Writing</i> has a more compact collection.
(Pat's been one of that aforementioned circle since the mid
80s.)<br>

but if not, oh well. Just curious about how, or if, you balance
these? TY</a></div>

Art vs. Commerce is one of those balances that have varied over the
years. It was my good luck that early in my career the stories I
had a taste for, and those people would buy, had an identifiable
overlap, so "finding my audience" wasn't insurmountable. What I
found most pressing back then wasn't content, but the need for
speed of production in pro publishing. Publishers wanted reliable
writers who would deliver on time and regularly; a book a year or
more.<br>
<br>
By mid-career, I was more-or-less trusting my audience. From whom a
writer had much LESS feedback at that time, therefore marginally
less crazy-making. (Because reader response, over any very wide
range of persons, is a contradictory cacophony. I was fortunate to
learn this early on even without the internet.) And my editors were
trusting both me and and their customers, so, while I certainly
wanted to write things my publishers could sell, most of my
pressure was internal and speed-related.<br>
<br>
Pat Wrede, as usual, had a good line for it: if you write something
you don't like thinking it's "for the market", and it doesn't sell,
you will have wasted your time utterly; and it's worse if it does,
because then people will just want <i>more</i> of what you didn't
want to write in the first place.<br>
<br>
Post-career, none of that applies anymore. I need only write what I
like (not that I could ever do anything else) and sales, though
nice, are mainly a way of keeping score. What's much harder now is
finding any story idea that I like well enough to write at all, and
that's enough different from the ever-larger pile of things I wrote
before that I bore neither myself (critical) nor my readers.<br>

Yes, "ser" is meant as a minor middle-upper-middle-class honorific,
roughly equivalent to "mister". There could be a matching "sera",
but Barrayarans would tend to revert to the more familiar
French/British "madame".<br>
<br>
I did recycle my "ser - sera" nomenclature to 5-gods Adria-Lodi,
both it and Komarr being inspired by historical Venice.<br>

Not really; SF and Fantasy are sort of universal receivers, that
can absorb all other genre tropes. I have written several different
genres even within the same series, and never really had to venture
"outside" to explore.<br>
<br>
Problems of how to professionally publish in more than one genre or
even one subgenre are challenging in the market, due to the way
"names" have to be built up to make minimally financially
successful sales volumes. Writers who make a go of this need to be
prolific (which I am not, especially) and/or to write under more
than one name. (Though e-publishing tips over the old-school game
board in interesting ways.)<br>

The novella is too short to publish in paperback by itself -- the
Subterranean Press limited hardcover was about the only way to get
it on paper without a few sibling stories to make up market weight.
That edition is sold out at the publisher, but one can still get
copies from Uncle Hugo's or Dreamhaven Books here in
Minneapolis.<br>
<br>
You can, of course, download the free Kindle app to most devices --
not sure about Nook and Apple Books.<br>
<br>
Still no Kobo, sorry.<br>

I've always wondered how much of a coincidence it really was.
Either way, thank you for writing books with such awesome &

That was serendipity. I do not remember at what point I gave
Cordelia's late dad his full name, from which Mark's (and Miles's)
actually come, whether it was in BiA or earlier. (Well, Da
Naismith's first name of course came much earlier, when Miles was
named after him.) The unit of money was also named way earlier.
Though if my belatedly seized inspiration looks like long-laid
planning, so much the better.<br>

I just wanted to comment that I recently happened upon your novels

Keys and found an obscure (to me at the time) author and the set. I
am so very glad that I picked up the works, as I only just finished
the first novel in the series. I look forward to getting to know

I'm so glad you discovered my work! Also that you nabbed the whole
set right off -- unlike my other more episodic series books, <i>The
Sharing Knife</i> really is one story in 4 volumes, and needs to be
read together like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br>
<br>
Much more exploration awaits you. Be it noted, some of these things
are not like the others, as I vary my style according to viewpoint
and world.<br>

They're distracted by the internet? It takes a long time to get
famous, and at that point, they're old and tired? People don't
write as fast as you imagine? Your question is rhetorical, sure,
but really, your guess is as good as mine.<br>
<br>
There is certainly no shortage of new writers with new works, so I
don't think you risk running out of books soon.<br>
<br>
Although I do note, the sort of cutting edge and science
speculation that only SF used to bring to isolated readers can now
be found online in abundance with the real thing, real science
doing amazing things that its practitioners are delighted to show
you. Hard to compete with that, or even keep up.<br>

run a book club on reddit where we read a different book of yours
every month. This month we are reading your short stories collected
in the anthologies Proto Zoa and Dreamweaver's Dilemma (DD). It's
just been pointed out to me that there isn't an eBook version of
the DD anthology, which means eBook readers have no way to read the
story "The Adventure of the Lady on the Embankment". Can you help
in any way?</a></div>

Afraid not, if you mean getting it into e-format.<br>
<br>
The story referred to, for those who are wondering, was my last
piece of fanfiction (Sherlock Holmes, in this case), written
somewhat out of the blue in my late 20s. I now think of it as the
baby writer trying to peck her way out of the egg, not breaking
through yet.<br>
<br>
When, in the mid 90s, the SF convention Boskone, at which I was
writer guest-of-honor, was putting together their traditional
souvenir book of unpublished or other oddments from their GoHs, I
didn't have many pieces of unpublished work, as I had done very few
short stories after I turned pro, and they'd all (eventually) sold
except for that very first novelette, "Dreamweaver's Dilemma".
Scraping the barrel, I found the typescript of that fan story,
missing its last page, and added it just to help fluff up
things.<br>
<br>
<i>DD</i> also contains the short story contents of the later
<i>Proto Zoa</i>, a few early essays, an introduction by Lillian
Stewart Carl some of which I think later got recycled into <i>The
Vorkosigan Companion</i>, and some material from the NESFA
editors.<br>
<br>
The NESFA Press edition of this is still available in trade
paperback, with a few copies sloshing around the used market.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://www.amazon.com/Dreamweavers-Dilemma-Lois-McMaster-Bujold/dp/0915368536/">
https://www.amazon.com/Dreamweavers-D...</a> or sometimes Uncle
Hugo's can get signed copies.<br>
<br>
I consider the fanfic piece to be juvenilia, not part of my early
pro work, or I'd have included it in <i>Proto Zoa</i>.<br>
<br>

Yeah, I enjoyed him too. At the moment, I don't know if he'll
impinge on another tale. He's kind of a homebody.<br>

sure what you are asking for. For some writers, I expect first
books recede into the dim mists of time and memory as an
increasingly vague blur. The continuing series that <i>Shards of
Honor</i> launched in 1986, the need for proofreading reprints of
various kinds over the years, and new reviews from readers still
just now discovering it has kept it relatively fresh in my
mind.<br>
<br>
It's... OK, I guess? At this point, 36 years on from first
publication (40 from first starting to write it), I'm pretty sure
of its survival in the marketplace, so I no longer feel much need
to defend it as a covertly-economically-anxious new writer
struggling to hold a spot on bookstore shelves. The kids'll be all
right, as some song fragment puts it.<br>
<br>
The characters from the book still seem to be finding life in some
unknown number of readers' minds, which is the only kind of life
they can have. So, all good.<br>

Nothing new on Pen & Des is in progress or in the pipeline right
now.<br>
<br>
However, I do have a rather unexpected personal nonfiction project
upcoming, an e-chapbook of family historical documents that I
compiled and edited, on which I'll be making a more complete
announcement on the blog here later this month when I make it
available through Kindle. So don't let your tablet get too dusty
yet.<br>
<br>
The e-chapbook will be titled <i>The Gerould Family of New
Hampshire in the Civil War</i>, and I've made a preview of the main
contents available in my "Lois's Writing" aka "My Writing" slot
here on Goodreads, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href=

"/questions/2363764-in-the-world-of-the-five-gods-how">In the world
of the five gods, how different are the afterlife experiences of
the various gods? That is to say, if a person is taken up by the
Brother, do they experience a truly different afterlife from
someone taken up by the Daughter? And, as a corollary, do each of
the gods have a separate "heaven" or is there one afterlife that
may be affected by the perceptions of the god whose gate you came
through?</a></div>

Not answerable -- the gods are ineffable -- and it's hard to say
what happens to a soul in the hands of any god over enough time.
But it's fair to guess that people who have been in the afterlife a
short time like a century or so will have the most resemblance to
their earthly selves, the way ghosts hold their forms only more so,
but will begin to change to something less imaginable over longer
time, like many millennia. "Union with god" may be rather literal
over those scales.<br>
<br>
Much the way the next 90 years may shape a person more than the
first 9 months, however critical those 9 months were for existence
at all. And will certainly be better remembered.<br>
<br>
So there would likely be the most perceived differences in one's
experience of the afterlife near its beginning, with, mm, maybe not
fading differences, but less understandable ones, as time goes
on.<br>
<br>
Or, imagine trying to explain college life to a 3-month fetus.
Heaven here is not a replication of life in the world only better,
but an existence qualitatively different, however much it still
depends on the world for its growth and sustenance.<br>
<br>
Remember, these are not creator gods, but created ones, emergent
properties of the world. Though for life after death, they are the
only game in town.<br>

this question would have changed through time and local polities
(countships). Before the end of the Time of Isolation, it wasn't a
question that could even be asked, as the tech did not exist. The
disruptions of the Occupation and its war would have prevented
anyone focusing on such issues, but the tech would have been
leaking slowly out from the more to the less developed areas. In
general, it's something that would be left to families, not taken
up in legislatures -- this could be good or bad.<br>
<br>
The law tended to skirt around "women's work". So it's more likely
any permissions would be the purview of the mother rather than the
father, for girls. Remember, minor girls are by default in the
legal custody of their mothers, not their fathers.<br>
<br>
By Gregor's reign, empire-wide "galactic standard", i.e.,
Cordelia-driven, customs of leaving the decision to individuals (so
yes, the women) would prevail. (And do remember, that's not the
only contraceptive on the market, tho' likely the most reliable --
older methods would also remain in circulation.) Celibacy (for
women) would remain a lingering social ideal long after it had
become medically moot, I expect. The way it does.<br>

One of the reasons the plot of that tale veered toward the social
rather than the scientific was indeed the timescale of realistic
research. I can think of ways it might have succeeded, and ways it
might have failed; the only certainty is that there would need to
be many trials to get it right, and even then it might flounder on
economic-feasibility rocks.<br>
<br>
I would point out that a number of attempted bio-solutions in our
world have not gone well; cane toads ferex. (Ask an Australian
about that one.)<br>

"/questions/2374659-as-an-author-how-do-you-feel-about">As an
author, how do you feel about content/trigger warnings? Some of
your books have unpleasant things happening to characters (e.g.
Elena Visconti). I really like those books, but I've recently been
adding my own warnings while recommending them to friends. Would
you be happy for an editor/publisher to add official warnings at
the start of a book, or would that be treading on your
toes?</a></div>

"/author/show/16094.Lois_McMaster_Bujold">Lois McMaster
Bujold</a></span> <span class='communityAnswerText'>Trigger and
content warnings are a custom that has arisen in online fan
fiction. Professional fiction for an adult market has never had
them, the audience being assumed to be grownups with agency capable
of making and owning their own choices. To me, it would feel like
infantilizing my audience.<br>
<br>
Somebody else choosing and applying such tags for my work
pre-publication would feel a little too close to censorship. Though
I suppose it would be better than direct censorship. (Though I can
see how it could be argued that this would actually remove the need
for censorship, as it maybe seems to do in fanfiction. But I
suspect it would just result in authors self-censoring in the
effort to avoid audience-and-sales-reducing tags, and editors and
publishers encouraging it for the same economic reasons.)<br>
<br>
There is also the problem, if one starts such a thing, of where to
<i>stop</i>, since there will always be one more outlier who could
be imagined to be unhappy about <i>something</i> in the content
however arcane or idiosyncratic. Thus those warning/tag blocks one
sometimes sees in fanfic that have a higher word-count than the
story being prefaced...<br>
<br>
That said, I am starting to see such warnings prefacing recent
professional work self-supplied by authors who seem to have come
out of the fanfiction culture. (It's almost a marker.) So we may be
on the verge of a generational divide with respect to this
custom.<br>
<br>
What friends have to say to friends when handing books around has
nothing to do with the foregoing, it should not be necessary to say
but probably is.<br>
<br>
Ta, L.<br>
<br>
(The way fan readers-and-writers set up their own ways of
categorizing and filtering work, for their own needs, see ferex
Ao3's methods of indexing, as contrasted with the way traditional
publishing and bookstores do, is a study worth its own essay or
possibly book.)</span></div>

with you as to the unwieldiness of the series name. (Some fans
abbreviate it "5GU" for "five gods universe" in casual posts, but I
felt that was not identifier enough for the uninitiated; also I
have not yet committed to my theological world-building extending
beyond one planet.) "Pentheon" is amusing and succinct, but might
make for some confusion with respect to one of my protagonist's
names.<br>
<br>
Not that there aren't people named things like "Theophilus" or
"Theodosia" in real life...<br>

myself to start it in the theory it was going to be a novella. When
I approached the ~40k word limit for that form and my crew had not
yet made it to Thasalon, I conceded. I toyed for a while with
splitting it into a novella duology, but decided I'd prefer to keep
the story together. As long as it didn't eat a year to write, which
it didn't, thankfully. (I still think of it as a novella that got
out of hand.) Well, part of the aim of the Pen & Des series was
that it was not to be bound to any pre-set template, so, all
good.<br>

I have a 40-year traditional publishing career behind me, which did
my marketing for me, pretty much. So I'm not the best person to
answer this question. I have no idea how such things work, but I'd
be very cautious of claims from would-be book marketers, or anyone
else who is making their money from you and not from your book (as
a publisher does.) There are simply too many ebooks competing for
too few eyes, too little reading time.<br>
<br>
This is the internet age, so there have to be a million self-help
sites and vids out there; the problem is finding a legitimate and
actually useful one. Kristine Katherine Rusch's blog is a good
known starting point for experienced advice. <a target="_blank"
rel="noopener nofollow" href=
"https://kriswrites.com/">https://kriswrites.com/</a> Another more
recent presenter I ran across who impressed me with being pretty
level-headed was YouTuber M.K. Williams, ferex <a target="_blank"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LsqEFv5tAo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LsqE...</a><br>

<br>
But ultimately, books have to sell themselves, be appealing enough
to enough readers to keep them coming back for more, and
recommending them on to their friends. This requires a) writing
enjoyable or useful books, and b) writing more books to come back
<i>for</i>. As a rule of thumb, both pre- and post-internet, a
writer is better off directing their limited time-energy budget
toward producing new quality work than various frantic or annoying
attempts at marketing.<br>
<br>
An error I saw in the early days of the internet egoldrush with
respect to b) was writers throwing all kinds of old crap up just to
have more items to catch the eye, ultimately counterproductive.
Every book put up needs to be good enough to bring its random
reader back for more, because that may be the only chance to snag
that readerly eye the writer gets. (The hitch in this plausible
advice is the definition of "good", which in reading is very
subjective. Understanding this has allowed quite a few indie
writers to do well in their own quirky niche markets that Big
Publishing is not structured to serve.)<br>
<br>
If any commenters do have actual experience with modern book
marketers, or "marketers" as the case may be, good or bad, do chime
in down below. It strikes me as an arena that would be rife with
scamming pitfalls.<br>

Correct, Joen's demon is not Des. But an interesting
compare-and-contrast about how much can go wrong with a demon too
long in the world under corrupt and corrupting and/or ignorant
masters.<br>
<br>
Desdemona was much luckier in her riders, not least because she
fell into shrewd and nurturing Temple hands soon enough.<br>
<br>
Best Temple vs. Worst Hedge is kind of cherry-picking the moral
gradient; there can be hedge sorcerers who do well, due to their
personal integrity, and Temple sorcerers who do badly due to their
lack of same -- we saw an example in Tronio. But the Temple's
oversight, or, more correctly, the oversight of the better folks in
the Temple, do try to improve the odds.<br>
<br>
A demon's underlying nature is chaotic-destructive; that never goes
away. Even a demon as "good" as Des could be spoiled if it fell
into the hands of a bad enough rider. Whether a demon as
<i>smart</i> as Des could get herself out of that trap, ah, more
promptly than natural is another interesting knock-on question.
With its own consequences...<br>
